In recent years, the\nanswers to questions about our cosmic origins have not come solely from the domain of astrophysics.\nWorking under the umbrella of emergent fields with names such as astrochemistry, astrobiology, and\nastro-particle physics, astrophysicists have recognized that they can benefit greatly from the\ncollaborative infusion of other sciences. To invoke multiple branches of science when answering the\nquestion, Where did we come from? empowers investigators with a previously unimagined breadth\nand depth of insight into how the universe works.\nIn \nOrigins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution\n, we introduce the reader to this new\nsynthesis of knowledge, which allows us to address not only the origin of the universe but also the\norigin of the largest structures that matter has formed, the origin of the stars that light the cosmos, the\norigin of planets that offer the likeliest sites for life, and the origin of life itself on one or more of\nthose planets.\nHumans remain fascinated with the topic of origins for many reasons, both logical and emotional.\nWe can hardly comprehend the essence of anything without knowing where it came from. And of all\nthe stories that we hear, those that recount our own origins engender the deepest resonance within us.\nSelf-centeredness bred into our bones by our evolution and experience on Earth has led us naturally\nto focus on local events and phenomena in the retelling of most origin stories. However, every\nadvance in our knowledge of the cosmos has revealed that we live on a cosmic speck of dust, orbiting\na mediocre star in the far suburbs of a common sort of galaxy, among a hundred billion galaxies in the\nuniverse. The news of our cosmic unimportance triggers impressive defense mechanisms in the human\npsyche. Many of us unwittingly resemble the man in the cartoon who gazes at the starry heavens and\nremarks to his companion, \u201cWhen I look at all those stars, I\u2019m struck by how insignificant they are.\u201d\nThroughout history, different cultures have produced creation myths that explain our origins as the\nresult of cosmic forces shaping our destiny. These histories have helped us to ward off feelings of\ninsignificance. Although origin stories typically begin with the big picture, they get down to Earth\nwith impressive speed, zipping past the creation of the universe, of all its contents, and of life on\nEarth, to arrive at long explanations of myriad details of human history and its social conflicts, as if\nwe somehow formed the center of creation.\nAlmost all the disparate answers to the quest of origins accept as their underlying premise that the\ncosmos behaves in accordance with general rules, which reveal themselves, at least in principle, to\nour careful examination of the world around us. Ancient Greek philosophers raised this premise to\nexalted heights, insisting that we humans possess the power to perceive how nature operates, as well\nas the underlying reality beneath what we observe: the fundamental truths that govern all else.

Twenty-three hundred\nyears ago, in his most famous reflection on our ignorance, the Greek philosopher Plato compared\nthose who strive for knowledge to prisoners chained in a cave, unable to see objects behind them, and\nwho must attempt to deduce from the shadows of these objects an accurate description of reality.\nWith this simile, Plato not only summarized humanity\u2019s attempts to understand the cosmos but also\nemphasized that we have a natural tendency to believe that mysterious, dimly sensed entities govern\nthe universe, privy to knowledge that we can, at best, glimpse only in part. From Plato to Buddha,\nfrom Moses to Mohammed, from a hypothesized cosmic creator to modern films about \u201cthe matrix,\u201d\nhumans in every culture have concluded that higher powers rule the cosmos, gifted with an\nunderstanding of the gulf between reality and superficial appearance.\nHalf a millennium ago, a new approach toward understanding nature slowly took hold. This attitude,\nwhich we now call science, arose from the confluence of new technologies and the discoveries that\nthey fostered. The spread of printed books across Europe, together with simultaneous improvements\nin travel by road and water, allowed individuals to communicate more quickly and effectively, so that\nthey could learn what others had to say and could respond far more rapidly than in the past. During\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, this hastened back-and-forth disputation and led to a new way\nof acquiring knowledge, based on the principle that the most effective means of understanding the\ncosmos relies on careful observations, coupled with attempts to specify broad and basic principles\nthat explain a set of these observations.\nOne more concept gave birth to science. Science depends on organized skepticism, that is, on\ncontinual, methodical doubting. Few of us doubt our own conclusions, so science embraces its\nskeptical approach by rewarding those who doubt someone else\u2019s. We may rightly call this approach\nunnatural; not so much because it calls for mistrusting someone else\u2019s thoughts, but because science\nencourages and rewards those who can demonstrate that another scientist\u2019s conclusions are just plain\nwrong. To other scientists, the scientist who corrects a colleague\u2019s error, or cites good reasons for\nseriously doubting his or her conclusions, performs a noble deed, like a Zen master who boxes the\nears of a novice straying from the meditative path, although scientists correct one another more as\nequals than as master and student. By rewarding a scientist who spots another\u2019s errors\u2014a task that\nhuman nature makes much easier than discerning one\u2019s own mistakes\u2014scientists as a group have\ncreated an inborn system of self-correction. Scientists have collectively created our most efficient\nand effective tool for analyzing nature, because they seek to disprove other scientists\u2019 theories even as\nthey support their earnest attempts to advance human knowledge. Science thus amounts to a collective\npursuit, but a mutual admiration society it is not, nor was meant to be.\nLike all attempts at human progress, the scientific approach works better in theory than in practice.\nNot all scientists doubt one another as effectively as they should. The need to impress scientists who\noccupy powerful positions, and who are sometimes swayed by factors that lie beyond their conscious\nknowledge, can interfere with science\u2019s self-correcting ability. In the long run, however, errors cannot\nendure, because other scientists will discover them and promote their own careers by trumpeting the\nnews. Those conclusions that do survive the attacks of other scientists will eventually achieve the\nstatus of scientific \u201claws,\u201d accepted as valid descriptions of reality, even though scientists understand\nthat each of these laws may some day find itself to be only part of a larger, deeper truth.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3951, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bc7ed12-72f2-4cea-824a-1418a7a660c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bc7ed12-72f2-4cea-824a-1418a7a660c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "287a44d7-83c5-4ada-8b49-47075129011d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "4913b889f8c8fedf745286db9ff90ca5f8b1d8e7933e961e8bc737d7e3d20fff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "But scientists hardly spend all their time attempting to prove one another mistaken. Most scientific\nendeavors proceed by testing imperfectly established hypotheses against slightly improved\nobservational results. Every once in a while, however, a significantly new take on an important theory\nemerges, or (more often in an age of technological advances) a whole new range of observations\nopens the way to a new set of hypotheses to explain these new results. The greatest moments in\nscientific history have arisen, and will always arise, when a new explanation, perhaps coupled with\nnew observational results, produces a seismic shift in our conclusions about the workings of nature.\nScientific progress depends on individuals in both camps: those who assemble better data and\nextrapolate carefully from it; and those who risk much\u2014and have much to gain if successful\u2014by\nchallenging widely accepted conclusions.\nScience\u2019s skeptical core makes it a poor competitor for human hearts and minds, which recoil from\nits ongoing controversies and prefer the security of seemingly eternal truths. If the scientific approach\nwere just one more interpretation of the cosmos, it would never have amounted to much; but science\u2019s\nbig-time success rests on the fact that it works. If you board an aircraft built according to science\u2014\nwith principles that have survived numerous attempts to prove them wrong\u2014you have a far better\nchance of reaching your destination than you do in an aircraft constructed by the rules of Vedic\nastrology.\nThroughout relatively recent history, people confronted with the success of science in explaining\nnatural phenomena have reacted in one of four ways. First, a small minority have embraced the\nscientific method as our best hope for understanding nature, and seek no additional ways to\ncomprehend the universe. Second, a much larger number ignore science, judging it uninteresting,\nopaque, or opposed to the human spirit. (Those who watch television greedily without ever pausing\nto wonder where the pictures and sound come from remind us that the words \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201cmachine\u201d\nshare deep etymological roots.) Third, another minority, conscious of the assault that science seems to\nmake upon their cherished beliefs, seek actively to disprove scientific results that annoy or enrage\nthem. They do so, however, quite outside the skeptical framework of science, as you can easily\nestablish by asking one of them, \u201cWhat evidence would convince you that you are wrong?\u201d These\nanti-scientists still feel the shock that John Donne described in his poem \u201cThe Anatomy of the World:\nThe First Anniversary,\u201d written in 1611 as the first fruits of modern science appeared:\nAnd new philosophy calls all in doubt,\nThe element of fire is quite put out,\nThe Sun is lost, and th\u2019earth, and no man\u2019s wit\nCan well direct him where to look for it.\nAnd freely men confess that this world\u2019s spent,\nWhen in the planets and the firmament\nThey seek so many new; they see that this [world]\nIs crumbled out again to his atomies.\n\u2019Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone . . .\nFourth, another large section of the public accepts the scientific approach to nature while maintaining\na belief in supernatural entities existing beyond our complete understanding that rule the cosmos.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3270, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed75301b-1cc0-4ec6-b824-a15c01bfac85": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed75301b-1cc0-4ec6-b824-a15c01bfac85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "302c8e47-8bad-4eb0-bfbc-cfb0d5d2437b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "71119c8edc92064c3691af361da111c6c59cb5c7d3b1d70e6518ff48b5b175b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Baruch Spinoza, the philosopher who created the strongest bridge between the natural and the\nsupernatural, rejected any distinction between nature \nand\n God, insisting instead that the cosmos is\nsimultaneously nature and God.

From these everything\nelse follows\n.\n\u2014Lucretius\nS\nome 14 billion years ago, at the beginning of time, all the space and all the matter and all the\nenergy of the known universe fit within a pinhead. The universe was then so hot that the basic forces\nof nature, which collectively describe the universe, were merged into a single, unified force. When\nthe universe was a roaring 10\n30\n degrees and just 10\n-43\n seconds old\u2014the time before which all of\nour theories of matter and space lose their meaning\u2014black holes spontaneously formed, disappeared,\nand formed again out of the energy contained within the unified force field. Under these extreme\nconditions, in what is admittedly speculative physics, the structure of space and time became severely\ncurved as it gurgled into a spongy, foamlike structure. During this epoch, phenomena described by\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity (the modern theory of gravity) and quantum mechanics (the\ndescription of matter on its smallest scales) were indistinguishable.\nAs the universe expanded and cooled, gravity split from the other forces. Soon thereafter, the strong\nnuclear force and the electro-weak force split from each other, an event accompanied by an enormous\nrelease of stored energy that induced a rapid, fifty-power-of-ten increase in the size of the universe.\nThe rapid expansion, known as the \u201cepoch of inflation,\u201d stretched and smoothed matter and energy so\nthat any variation in density from one part of the universe to the next became less than one part in a\nhundred thousand.\nContinuing onward with what is now laboratory-confirmed physics, the universe was hot enough for\nphotons to spontaneously convert their energy into matter-antimatter particle pairs, which\nimmediately thereafter annihilated each other, returning their energy back to photons. For reasons\nunknown, this symmetry between matter and antimatter had been \u201cbroken\u201d at the previous force\nsplitting, which led to a slight excess of matter over antimatter. The asymmetry was small but crucial\nfor the future evolution of the universe: for every 1 billion antimatter particles, 1 billion+1 matter\nparticles were born.\nAs the universe continued to cool, the electro-weak force split into the electromagnetic force and the\nweak nuclear force, completing the four distinct and familiar forces of nature. While the energy of the\nphoton bath continued to drop, pairs of matter-antimatter particles could no longer be created\nspontaneously from the available photons. All remaining pairs of matter-antimatter particles swiftly\nannihilated, leaving behind a universe with one particle of ordinary matter for every billion photons\n\u2014and no antimatter. Had this matter-over-antimatter asymmetry not emerged, the expanding universe\nwould forever be composed of light and nothing else, not even astrophysicists. Over a roughly three-\nminute period, the matter became protons and neutrons, many of which combined to become the\nsimplest atomic nuclei. Meanwhile, free-roving electrons thoroughly scattered the photons to and fro,\ncreating an opaque soup of matter and energy.\nWhen the universe cooled below a few thousand degrees Kelvin \u2014somewhat hotter than a blast\nfurnace\u2014the loose electrons moved slowly enough to get snatched from the soup by the roving nuclei", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3407, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ef1006d-a28f-4100-bf9e-4a0014f9d672": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ef1006d-a28f-4100-bf9e-4a0014f9d672", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "412c47cc-b6f2-4518-8c44-918a7e70b581", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "7d79a9ae6707f5cbfc56ef8a050fbf080aad092bc870b749c58935df4c1d2aa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "to make complete atoms of hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the three lightest elements. The universe\nhad now become (for the first time) transparent to visible light, and these free-flying photons are\nobservable today as the cosmic microwave background. During its first billion years, the universe\ncontinued to expand and cool as matter gravitated into the massive concentrations we call galaxies.\nWithin just the volume of the cosmos that we can see, a hundred billion of these galaxies formed, each\ncontaining hundreds of billions of stars that undergo thermonuclear fusion in their cores. Those stars\nwith more than about ten times the mass of the Sun achieve sufficient pressure and temperature in their\ncores to manufacture dozens of elements heavier than hydrogen, including the elements that compose\nplanets and the life upon them. These elements would be embarrassingly useless were they to remain\nlocked inside the star. But high-mass stars explode in death, scattering their chemically enriched guts\nthroughout the galaxy.\nAfter 7 or 8 billion years of such enrichment, an undistinguished star (the Sun) was born in an\nundistinguished region (the Orion arm) of an undistinguished galaxy (the Milky Way) in an\nundistinguished part of the universe (the outskirts of the Virgo supercluster). The gas cloud from\nwhich the Sun formed contained a sufficient supply of heavy elements to spawn a few planets,\nthousands of asteroids, and billions of comets. During the formation of this star system, matter\ncondensed and accreted out of the parent cloud of gas while circling the Sun. For several hundred\nmillion years, the persistent impacts of high-velocity comets and other leftover debris rendered\nmolten the surfaces of the rocky planets, preventing the formation of complex molecules. As less and\nless accretable matter remained in the solar system, the planets\u2019 surfaces began to cool. The planet we\ncall Earth formed in an orbit where its atmosphere can sustain oceans, largely in liquid form. Had\nEarth formed much closer to the Sun, the oceans would have vaporized. Had Earth formed much\nfarther, the oceans would have frozen. In either case, life as we know it would not have evolved.\nWithin the chemically rich liquid oceans, by a mechanism unknown, simple anaerobic bacteria\nemerged that unwittingly transformed Earth\u2019s carbon dioxide\u2013rich atmosphere into one with sufficient\noxygen to allow aerobic organisms to form, evolve, and dominate the oceans and land. These same\noxygen atoms, normally found in pairs (O\n2\n), also combined in threes to form ozone (O\n3\n) in the upper\natmosphere, which shields Earth\u2019s surface from most of the Sun\u2019s molecule-hostile ultraviolet\nphotons.\nThe remarkable diversity of life on Earth, and (we may presume) elsewhere in the universe, arises\nfrom the cosmic abundance of carbon and the countless number of molecules (simple and complex)\nmade from it; more varieties of carbon-based molecules exist than of all other molecules combined.\nBut life is fragile. Earth\u2019s encounters with large objects, left over from the formation of the solar\nsystem, which were once common events, still wreak intermittent havoc upon our ecosystem. A mere\n65 million years ago (less than 2 percent of Earth\u2019s past), a 10-trillion-ton asteroid struck what is\nnow the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and obliterated over 70 percent of Earth\u2019s land-based flora and fauna-\nincluding all the dinosaurs, the dominant land animals of that epoch.

The interplay of these characters in our cosmic drama underlies all\nbiological and chemical phenomena. Hence everything fundamental and familiar to us earthlings\nbegins with, and rests upon, the laws of physics. When we apply these laws to astronomical settings,\nwe deal with physics writ large, which we call astrophysics.\nIn almost any area of scientific inquiry, but especially in physics, the frontier of discovery lives at\nthe extremes of our ability to measure events and situations. In an extreme of matter, such as the\nneighborhood of a black hole, gravity strongly warps the surrounding space-time continuum. At an\nextreme of energy, thermonuclear fusion sustains itself within the 15-million-degree cores of stars.\nAnd at every extreme imaginable we find the outrageously hot and dense conditions that prevailed\nduring the first few moments of the universe. To understand what happens in each of these scenarios\nrequires laws of physics discovered after 1900, during what physicists now call the modern era, to\ndistinguish it from the classical era that includes all previous physics.\nOne major feature of classical physics is that events and laws and predictions actually make sense\nwhen you stop and think about them. They were all discovered and tested in ordinary laboratories in\nordinary buildings. The laws of gravity and motion, of electricity and magnetism, and of the nature\nand behavior of heat energy are still taught in high school physics classes. These revelations about the\nnatural world fueled the industrial revolution, itself transforming culture and society in ways\nunimagined by generations that came before, and remain central to what happens, and why, in the\nworld of everyday experience.\nBy contrast, nothing makes sense in modern physics because everything happens in regimes that lie\nfar beyond those to which our human senses respond. This is a good thing. We may happily report that\nour daily lives remain wholly devoid of extreme physics. On a normal morning, you get out of bed,\nwander around the house, eat something, then dash out the front door.

Or what if you go to a sumo wrestling match after work, only to see the two nearly spherical\ngentlemen collide, disappear, and then spontaneously become two beams of light that leave the room\nin opposite directions?

Just twenty-\nsix years old in 1905, working as a patent examiner in Bern, Switzerland, Einstein offered further\ndetails, including his best-known equation in another, remarkably short (two-and-a-half-page) paper\npublished later the same year in the same journal: \u201cIst die Tr\u00e4gheit eines K\u00f6rpers von seinem\nEnergieinhalt abh\u00e4ngig?\u201d or \u201cDoes the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?\u201d To save you\nthe effort of locating the original article, of designing an experiment, and of thus testing Einstein\u2019s\ntheory, the answer to the paper\u2019s title is yes. As Einstein wrote,\nIf a body gives off the energy E in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by E/c\n2\n. . . .The mass\nof a body is a measure of its energy-content; if the energy changes by E, the mass changes in the\nsame sense.\nUncertain as to the truth of his statement, he then suggested,\nIt is not impossible that with bodies whose energy-content is variable to a high degree (e.g. with\nradium salts) the theory may be successfully put to the test.\n*\nThere you have it: the algebraic recipe for all occasions when you want to convert matter into\nenergy, or energy into matter. \nE = mc\n2\n\u2014energy equals mass times the square of the speed of light\u2014\ngives us a supremely powerful computational tool that extends our capacity to know and understand\nthe universe from as it is now, all the way back to infinitesimal fractions of a second after the birth of\nthe cosmos. With this equation, you can tell how much radiant energy a star can produce, or how much\nyou could gain by converting the coins in your pocket into useful forms of energy.\nThe most familiar form of energy\u2014shining all around us, though often unrecognized and unnamed in\nour mind\u2019s eye\u2014is the photon, a massless, irreducible particle of visible light, or of any other form of\nelectromagnetic radiation.

Currently, the temperature of our expanding universe, found by measuring the\nbath of microwave photons that pervades all of space, is a mere 2.73 degrees Kelvin. (On the Kelvin\nscale, all temperatures are positive: particles have the least possible energy at 0 degrees; room\ntemperature is about 295 degrees; and water boils at 373 degrees.) Like the photons of visible light,\nmicrowave photons are too cool to have any realistic ambitions of turning themselves into particles\nvia \nE = mc\n2\n. In other words, no known particle has a mass so low that it can be made from the\nmeager energy of a microwave photon. The same holds true for the photons that form radio waves,\ninfrared, and visible light, as well as ultraviolet and X rays. More simply expressed, particle\ntransmutations all require gamma rays.

Roll the clocks backward\nsome more\u2014say, 13.7 billion years\u2014and you land squarely in the post\u2013big bang primordial soup, a\ntime when the temperature of the cosmos was high enough to be astrophysically interesting as gamma\nrays filled the universe.\nTo understand the behavior of space, time, matter, and energy from the big bang to present day is one\nof the greatest triumphs of human thought. If you seek a complete explanation for the events of the\nearliest moments, when the universe was smaller and hotter than ever thereafter, you must find a way\nto enable the four known forces of nature\u2014gravity, electromagnetism, the strong and the weak nuclear\nforces\u2014to talk to one another, to unify and become a single meta-force. You must also find a way to\nreconcile two currently incompatible branches of physics: quantum mechanics (the science of the\nsmall) and general relativity (the science of the large).\nSpurred by the\n successful marriage of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism during the mid-\ntwentieth century, physicists moved swiftly to blend quantum mechanics and general relativity into a\nsingle and coherent theory of quantum gravity.

Later still, the electro-weak\nforce split into the electromagnetic and the weak nuclear forces, laying bare four distinct and familiar\nforces\u2014with the weak force controlling radioactive decay, the strong force binding together the\nparticles in each atomic nucleus, the electromagnetic force holding atoms together in molecules, and\ngravity binding matter in bulk.

None of these\nparticle families, so far as we now know, can be divided into anything smaller or more basic.\nFundamental though they are, each family of particles comes in several species.

And except under the\nmost extreme conditions, you\u2019ll never catch a quark all by itself; it will always be clutching on to one\nor two other quarks. In fact, the force that keeps two (or more) of them together actually grows\nstronger\n as you separate them\u2014as if some sort of subnuclear rubber band held them together.\nSeparate the quarks sufficiently far, and the rubber band snaps. The energy stored in the stretched\nband now summons \nE = mc\n2\n to create a new quark at each end, leaving you back where you started.\nDuring the quark-lepton era in the cosmos\u2019s first trillionth of a second, the universe had a density\nsufficient for the average separation between unattached quarks to rival the separation between\nattached quarks. Under those conditions, allegiances between adjacent quarks could not be\nestablished unambiguously, so they moved freely among themselves. The experimental detection of\nthis state of matter, understandably named \u201cquark soup,\u201d was reported for the first time in 2002 by a\nteam of physicists working at the Brookhaven National Laboratories on Long Island.\nThe combination of observation and theory suggests that an episode in the very early universe,\nperhaps during one of the splits between different types of force, endowed the cosmos with a\nremarkable asymmetry, in which particles of matter outnumbered particles of antimatter by only about\none part in a billion\u2014a difference that allows us to exist today. That tiny discrepancy in population\ncould hardly have been noticed amid the continuous creation, annihilation, and recreation of quarks\nand antiquarks, electrons and anti-electrons (better known as positrons), and neutrinos and\nantineutrinos. During that era, the odd man out\u2014the slight preponderance of matter over antimatter\u2014\nhad plenty of opportunities to find other particles with which to annihilate, and so did all the other\nparticles.\nBut not for much longer. As the universe continued to expand and cool, its temperature fell rapidly\nbelow 1 trillion degrees Kelvin. A millionth of a second had now passed since the beginning, but this\ntepid universe no longer had a temperature or density sufficient to cook quarks. All the quarks quickly\ngrabbed dance partners, creating a permanent new family of heavy particles called hadrons (from the\nGreek \nhadros\n, meaning \u201cthick\u201d). That quark-to-hadron transition quickly produced protons and\nneutrons as well as other, less familiar types of heavy particles, all composed of various\ncombinations of quarks. The slight matter-antimatter asymmetry in the quark-lepton soup now passed\nto the hadrons, with extraordinary consequences.\nAs the universe cooled, the amount of energy available for the spontaneous creation of particles\ndeclined continuously. During the hadron era, photons could no longer invoke \nE = mc\n2\n to manufacture\nquark-antiquark pairs: their \nE\n could not cover the pairs\u2019 \nmc\n2\n. In addition, the photons that emerged\nfrom all the remaining annihilations continued to lose energy to the ever-expanding universe, so their\nenergies eventually fell below the threshold required to create hadron-antihadron pairs.

Where else could you find a neutral vector boson exchanged between a negative muon and a\nmuon neutrino? Or a gluon exchange binding together a strange quark and a charmed quark? And\nwhere else can you meet squarks, photinos, and gravitinos? Alongside these seemingly countless\nparticles with peculiar names, particle physicists must contend with a parallel universe of\nanti\nparticles, collectively known as antimatter. Despite its persistent appearance in science fiction\nstories, antimatter is real. And as you might suppose, it does tend to annihilate upon contact with\nordinary matter.\nThe universe reveals a peculiar romance between antiparticles and particles. They can be born\ntogether out of pure energy, and they can annihilate as they reconvert their combined mass back into\nenergy. In 1932, the American physicist Carl David Anderson discovered the anti-electron, the\npositively charged, antimatter counterpart to the negatively charged electron. Since then, particle\nphysicists have routinely made antiparticles of all varieties in the world\u2019s particle accelerators, but\nonly recently have they assembled antiparticles into whole atoms. Since 1996, an international group\nled by Walter Oelert of the Institute for Nuclear Physics Research in J\u00fclich, Germany, has created\natoms of antihydrogen, in which an anti-electron happily orbits an antiproton. To make these first anti-\natoms, the physicists used the giant particle accelerator operated by the European Organization for\nNuclear Research (better known by its French acronym CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland, where so\nmany important contributions to particle physics have occurred.\nThe physicists use a simple creation method: make a bunch of anti-electrons and a bunch of\nantiprotons, bring them together at a suitable temperature and density, and wait for them to combine to\nform atoms. During their first round of experiments, Oelert\u2019s team produced nine atoms of\nantihydrogen. But in a world dominated by ordinary matter, life as an antimatter atom can be\nprecarious. The antihydrogen atoms survived for less than 40 nanoseconds (40 billionths of a second)\nbefore annihilating with ordinary atoms.\nThe discovery of the anti-electron was one of the great triumphs of theoretical physics, for its\nexistence had been predicted just a few years earlier by the British-born physicist Paul A. M. Dirac.\nTo describe matter on the smallest size scales\u2014those of atomic and subatomic particles\u2014physicists\ndeveloped a new branch of physics during the 1920s to explain the results of their experiments with\nthese particles. Using newly established rules, now known as quantum theory, Dirac postulated from a\nsecond solution to his equation that a phantom electron from the \u201cother side\u201d might occasionally pop\ninto the world as an ordinary electron, leaving behind a gap or hole in the sea of negative energies.\nAlthough Dirac hoped to explain protons in this way, other physicists suggested that this hole would\nreveal itself experimentally as a positively charged anti-electron, which had come to be known as a", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3207, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d9e0211-e25a-41c0-87f8-5398213aca0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d9e0211-e25a-41c0-87f8-5398213aca0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ba299c53-f86f-4705-98a9-48465076fde4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "60f7efb7ebfcebc8788f72b25f50ece4da4fd79da9376f4b115cd3cf76d03233", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "positron for its positive electric charge.

Physicists cannot guarantee that all the solutions of an equation correspond to events\nin the real world, but if a mathematical model of a physical phenomenon is correct, manipulating its\nequations can be as useful as (and somewhat easier than) manipulating the entire universe. As with\nDirac and antimatter, such steps often lead to verifiable predictions. If the predictions prove\nincorrect, then the theory is discarded. But regardless of the physical outcome, a mathematical model\nensures that the conclusions you may draw from it are both logical and internally consistent.\nSubatomic particles have many measurable features, of which mass and electric charge rank among\nthe most important. Except for the particle\u2019s mass, which is always the same for a particle and its\nantiparticle, the specific properties of each type of antiparticle will always be precisely opposite to\nthose of the particle for which it provides the \u201canti.\u201d For example, the positron has the same mass as\nthe electron, but the positron has one unit of positive charge while the electron has one unit of\nnegative charge. Similarly, the antiproton provides the oppositely charged antiparticle of the proton.\nBelieve it or not, the chargeless neutron also has an antiparticle. It\u2019s called\u2014you guessed it\u2014the\nantineutron. An antineutron has an opposite zero charge with respect to the ordinary neutron. This\narithmetical magic derives from the particular triplet of fractionally charged particles (the quarks)\nthat form neutrons. The three quarks that compose a neutron have charges of \u2013\n, \u2013\n, and +\n, while\nthose in the antineutron have charges of \n, \n, and \u2013\n. Each set of three quark charges adds up to zero\nnet charge, yet the corresponding components do have opposite charges.\nAntimatter can pop into existence out of thin air. If gamma-ray photons have sufficiently high energy,\nthey can transform themselves into electron-positron pairs, thus converting all of their seriously large\nenergy into a small amount of matter, in a process whose energy side fulfills Einstein\u2019s famous\nequation \nE = mc\n2\n.\nIn the language of Dirac\u2019s original interpretation, the gamma-ray photon kicked an electron out of the\ndomain of negative energies, creating an ordinary electron and an electron hole. The reverse process\ncan also occur. If a particle and an antiparticle collide, they will annihilate by refilling the hole and\nemitting gamma rays. Gamma rays are the sort of radiation you should avoid.\nIf you somehow manage to manufacture a blob of antiparticles at home, you have a wolf by the ears.\nStorage would immediately become a challenge, because your antiparticles would annihilate with any\nconventional sack or grocery bag (either paper or plastic) in which you chose to confine or carry\nthem. A cleverer storage mechanism involves trapping the charged antiparticles within the confines of\na strong magnetic field, where they are repelled by invisible but highly effective magnetic \u201cwalls.\u201d If\nyou embed the magnetic field in a vacuum, you can render the antiparticles safe from annihilation with\nordinary matter.

Perhaps the original \nStar\nTrek\n television and film series embodied this fact, but if memory serves, Captain Kirk continually\nasked for \u201cmore power\u201d from the matter-antimatter drives, and Scotty invariably replied in his\nScottish accent that \u201cthe engines canna take it.\u201d\nAlthough physicists expect hydrogen and antihydrogen atoms to behave identically, they have not yet\nverified this prediction experimentally, mainly because of the difficulty they face in keeping\nantihydrogen atoms in existence, rather than having them annihilate almost immediately with protons\nand electrons. They would like to verify that the detailed behavior of a positron bound to an\nantiproton in an antihydrogen atom obeys all the laws of quantum theory, and that an anti-atom\u2019s\ngravity behaves precisely as we expect of ordinary atoms. Could an anti-atom produce antigravity\n(repulsive) instead of ordinary gravity (attractive)? All theory points toward the latter, but the former,\nif it should prove correct, would offer amazing new insights into nature. On atomic-size scales, the\nforce of gravity between any two particles is immeasurably small. Instead of gravity, electromagnetic\nand nuclear forces dominate the behavior of these tiny particles, because both forces are much, much\nstronger than gravity. To test for antigravity, you would need enough anti-atoms to make ordinary-\nsized objects, so that you can measure their bulk properties and compare them to ordinary matter. If a\nset of billiard balls (and, of course, the billiard table and the cue sticks) were made of antimatter,\nwould a game of anti-pool be indistinguishable from a game of pool? Would an anti\u2013eight ball fall\ninto the corner pocket in exactly the same way as an ordinary eight ball? Would anti-planets orbit an\nanti-star the way that ordinary planets orbit ordinary stars?\nIt\u2019s philosophically sensible, and in line with all the predictions of modern physics, to presume that\nthe bulk properties of antimatter will prove to be identical to those of ordinary matter\u2014normal\ngravity, normal collisions, normal light, and so forth. Unfortunately, this means that if an anti-galaxy\nwere headed our way, on a collision course with the Milky Way, it would remain indistinguishable\nfrom an ordinary galaxy until it was too late to do anything about it. But this fearsome fate cannot be\ncommon in the universe today because if, for example, a single anti-star annihilated with a single\nordinary star, the conversion of their matter and antimatter into gamma-ray energy would be swift,\nviolent, and total. If two stars with masses similar to the Sun\u2019s (each containing 10\n57\n particles) were\nto collide in our galaxy, their melding would produce an object so luminous that it would temporarily\noutproduce all the energy of all the stars of 100 million galaxies and fry us to an untimely end. We\nhave no compelling evidence that such an event has ever occurred anywhere in the universe. So, best\nwe can judge, the universe is dominated by ordinary matter, and has been since the first few minutes\nafter the big bang. Thus total annihilation through matter-antimatter collisions need not rank among\nyour chief safety concerns on your next intergalactic voyage.\nStill, the universe now seems disturbingly imbalanced: we expect particles and antiparticles to be\ncreated in equal numbers, yet we find a cosmos dominated by ordinary particles, which seem to be\nperfectly happy without their antiparticles.

With every passing\nmoment the universe got bigger as more space came into existence from nothing (not easy to imagine,\nbut here, evidence speaks louder than common sense). As the universe expanded, it grew cooler and\ndimmer. For hundreds of millennia, matter and energy cohabited in a kind of thick soup in which\nspeedy electrons continually scattered photons of light to and fro.\nBack then, if your mission had been to see across the universe, you couldn\u2019t have done so. Any\nphotons entering your eye would, just nanoseconds or picoseconds earlier, have bounced off electrons\nright in front of your face. You would have seen only a glowing fog in all directions, and your entire\nsurroundings\u2014luminous, translucent, reddish-white in color\u2014would have been nearly as bright as\nthe surface of the Sun.\nAs the universe expanded, the energy carried by each photon decreased. Eventually, about the time\nthat the young universe reached its 380,000th birthday, its temperature dropped below 3,000 degrees,\nwith the result that protons and helium nuclei could permanently capture electrons, thus bringing\natoms into the universe. In previous epochs, every photon had sufficient energy to break apart a newly\nformed atom, but now the photons had lost this ability, thanks to the cosmic expansion. With fewer\nunattached electrons to gum up the works, the photons could finally race through space without\nbumping into anything. That\u2019s when the universe became transparent, the fog lifted, and a cosmic\nbackground of visible light was set free.\nThat cosmic background persists to this day, the remnant of leftover light from a dazzling, sizzling\nearly universe. It\u2019s a ubiquitous bath of photons, acting as much like waves as they do like particles.\nEach photon\u2019s wavelength equals the separation between one of its wiggly wave crests and the next\u2014\na distance you could measure with a ruler, if you could get your hands on a photon. All photons travel\nat the same speed in a vacuum, 186,000 miles per second (naturally called the speed of light), so\nphotons with shorter wavelengths have a larger number of wave crests passing a particular point each\nsecond. Shorter-wavelength photons therefore pack more wiggles into a given interval of time, so\nwill have higher frequencies\u2014more wiggles per second. Each photon\u2019s frequency provides a direct\nmeasure of its energy: the higher the photon frequency, the more energy that photon \ncarries.\nAs the cosmos cooled, photons lost energy to the expanding universe. The photons born in the\ngamma-ray and X-ray parts of the spectrum morphed into ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared\nphotons. As their wavelengths grew larger, they became cooler and less energetic, but they never\nstopped being photons. Today, 13.7 billion years after the beginning, the photons of the cosmic\nbackground have shifted down the spectrum to become microwaves.

One hundred billion years from now, when the universe has expanded and cooled\nsome more, future astrophysicists will describe the CBR as the \u201ccosmic radio-wave background.\u201d\nThe temperature of the universe drops as the size of the universe grows. It\u2019s a physical thing. As\ndifferent parts of the universe move apart, the wavelengths of the photons in the CBR must increase:\nthe cosmos stretches these waves within the spandex fabric of space and time. Because every\nphoton\u2019s energy varies in inverse proportion to its wavelength, all the free-traveling photons will lose\nhalf their original energy for every doubling in size of the cosmos.\nAll objects with temperatures above absolute zero will radiate photons throughout all parts of the\nspectrum. But that radiation always has a peak somewhere. The peak energy output of an ordinary\nhousehold light bulb lies in the infrared part of the spectrum, which you can detect as warmth on your\nskin. Of course light bulbs also emit plenty of visible light, or we wouldn\u2019t buy them. So you can feel\na lamp\u2019s radiation as well as see it.\nThe peak output of the cosmic background radiation occurs at a wavelength of about 1 millimeter,\nsmack dab in the microwave part of the spectrum. The static that you hear on a walkie-talkie comes\nfrom an ambient bath of microwaves, a few percent of which are from the CBR. The rest of the\n\u201cnoise\u201d comes from the Sun, cell phones, police radar guns, and so on. Besides peaking in the\nmicrowave region, the CBR also contains some radio waves (which allow it to contaminate Earth-\nbased radio signals) and a vanishingly small number of photons with energies higher than those of\nmicrowaves.\nThe Ukrainian-born American physicist George Gamow and his colleagues predicted the existence\nof the CBR during the 1940s, consolidating their efforts in a 1948 paper that applied the then-known\nlaws of physics to the strange conditions of the early universe. The foundation for their ideas came\nfrom the 1927 paper by Georges Edouard Lema\u00eetre, a Belgian astronomer and Jesuit priest, now\ngenerally recognized as the \u201cfather\u201d of big bang cosmology. But two U.S. physicists, Ralph Alpher\nand Robert Herman, who had previously collaborated with Gamow, first estimated what the\ntemperature of the cosmic background ought to be.\nIn hindsight, Alpher, Gamow, and Herman had what today seems a relatively simple argument, one\nwhich we have already made: the fabric of space-time was smaller yesterday than it is today, and\nsince it was smaller, basic physics requires that it was hotter. So the physicists turned back the clock\nto imagine the epoch we have described, the time when the universe was so hot that all its atomic\nnuclei were laid bare because photon collisions knocked all electrons loose to roam freely through\nspace. Under those conditions, Alpher and Herman hypothesized, photons could not have sped\nuninterrupted across the universe, as they do today. The photons\u2019 current free ride requires that the\ncosmos grew sufficiently cool for the electrons to settle into orbits around the atomic nuclei. This\nformed complete atoms and allowed light to travel without obstruction.\nAlthough Gamow had the crucial insight that the early universe must have been much hotter than our\nuniverse today, Alpher and Herman were the first to calculate what its temperature would be today: 5\ndegrees Kelvin. Yes, they got the number wrong\u2014the CBR actually has a temperature of 2.73 degrees\nKelvin. But these three guys nevertheless performed a successful extrapolation back into the depths of\nlong-vanished cosmic epochs\u2014as great a feat as any other in the history of science.

In 1948, the same year that Alpher and Herman\u2019s paper\nappeared, a rival \u201csteady state\u201d theory of the universe appeared in two papers published in England,\none coauthored by the mathematician Hermann Bondi and the astrophysicist Thomas Gold, the other\nby the cosmologist Fred Hoyle. The steady state theory requires that the universe, though expanding,\nhas always looked the same\u2014a hypothesis with a deeply attractive simplicity. But because the\nuniverse is expanding, and because a steady state universe would not have been any hotter or denser\nyesterday than today, the Bondi-Gold-Hoyle scenario maintained that matter continuously pops into\nour universe at just the right rate to maintain a constant average density in the expanding cosmos. In\ncontrast, the big bang theory (given its name in scorn by Fred Hoyle) requires that all matter come\ninto existence at one instant, which some find more emotionally satisfying. Notice that the steady state\ntheory takes the issue of the origin of the universe and throws it backward an infinite distance in time\n\u2014highly convenient for those who would rather not examine this thorny problem.\nThe prediction of the cosmic background radiation amounted to a shot across the bow of the steady\nstate theorists. The CBR\u2019s existence would clearly demonstrate that the universe was once far\ndifferent\u2014much smaller and hotter\u2014from the way we find it today. The first direct observations of\nthe CBR therefore put the first nails in the coffin of the steady state theory (though Fred Hoyle never\nfully accepted the CBR as disproving his elegant theory, going to his grave attempting to explain the\nradiation as arising from other causes). In 1964, the CBR was inadvertently and serendipitously\ndiscovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at the Bell Telephone Laboratories (Bell Labs, for\nshort) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Little more than a decade later, Penzias and Wilson received the\nNobel Prize for their good luck and hard work.\nWhat led Penzias and Wilson to their Nobel Prize? During the early 1960s, physicists all knew\nabout microwaves, but almost no one had created the capability of detecting weak signals in the\nmicrowave portion of the spectrum. Back then, most wireless communication (e.g., receivers,\ndetectors, and transmitters) rode on radio waves, which have longer wavelengths than microwaves.\nFor these, scientists needed a shorter-wavelength detector and a sensitive antenna to capture them.\nBell Labs had one, a king-size, horn-shaped antenna that could focus and detect microwaves as well\nas any apparatus on Earth.\nIf you\u2019re going to send or receive a signal of any kind, you don\u2019t want other signals to contaminate\nit. Penzias and Wilson were trying to open up a new channel of communication for Bell Labs\u2014so\nthey wanted to pin down how much contaminating \u201cbackground\u201d interference these signals would\nexperience\u2014from the Sun, from the center of the galaxy, from terrestrial sources, from whatever.\nThey therefore embarked on a standard, important, and entirely innocent measurement, aimed at\nestablishing how easily they could detect microwave signals.

But they\nfound background noise in the signal that didn\u2019t go away, and they couldn\u2019t figure out how to get rid of\nit. The noise seemed to come from every direction above the horizon, and it didn\u2019t change with time.\nFinally they looked inside their giant horn. Pigeons were nesting there, leaving a white dielectric\nsubstance (pigeon poop) everywhere nearby. Things must have been getting desperate for Penzias and\nWilson: could the droppings, they wondered, be responsible for the background noise? They cleaned\nit up, and sure enough, the noise dropped a bit. But it still wouldn\u2019t go away. The paper they\npublished in 1965 in \nThe\n \nAstrophysical Journal\n refers to the persistent puzzle of an inexplicable\n\u201cexcess antenna temperature,\u201d rather than the astronomical discovery of the century.\nWhile Penzias and Wilson were scrubbing bird droppings from their antenna, a team of physicists at\nPrinceton University led by Robert H. Dicke was building a detector specifically designed to find the\nCBR that Gamow, Alpher, and Herman had predicted. The professors, however, lacked the resources\nof Bell Labs, so their work proceeded more slowly. The moment that Dicke and his colleagues heard\nabout Penzias and Wilson\u2019s results, they knew that they\u2019d been scooped. The Princeton team knew\nexactly what the \u201cexcess antenna temperature\u201d was. Everything fit the theory: the temperature, the fact\nthat the signal came from all directions in equal amounts, and that it wasn\u2019t linked in time with Earth\u2019s\nrotation or Earth\u2019s position in orbit around the Sun.\nBut why should\n anybody accept the interpretation? For good reason. Photons take time to reach us from\ndistant parts of the cosmos, so we inevitably look back in time whenever we look outward into space.\nThis means that if the intelligent inhabitants of a galaxy far, far away measured the temperature of the\ncosmic background radiation for themselves, long before we managed to so do, they should have\nfound its temperature to be greater than 2.73 degrees Kelvin, because they would have inhabited the\nuniverse when it was younger, smaller, and hotter than it is today.\nCan such an audacious assertion be tested? Yup. Turns out that the compound of carbon and nitrogen\ncalled cyanogen\u2014best known to convicted murderers as the active ingredient of the gas administered\nby their executioners\u2014will become excited by exposure to microwaves. If the microwaves are\nwarmer than the ones in our CBR, they will excite the molecule a little more effectively than our\nmicrowaves do. The cyanogen compounds thus act as a cosmic thermometer. When we observe them\nin distant, and thus younger, galaxies, they should find themselves bathed in a warmer cosmic\nbackground than the cyanogen in our Milky Way galaxy. In other words, those galaxies ought to live\nmore excited lives than we do. And they do. The spectrum of cyanogen in distant galaxies shows the\nmicrowaves to have just the temperature we expect at these earlier cosmic times.\nYou can\u2019t make this stuff up.\nThe CBR does far more for astrophysicists than to provide direct evidence for a hot early universe,\nand thus for the big bang model.

When the time was right, each photon began its cross-cosmos journey at the point\nwhere it smacked into the last electron that would ever stand in its way. As more and more photons\nescaped without being deflected by electrons (thanks to electrons joining nuclei to form atoms) they\ncreated an expanding shell of photons that astrophysicists call \u201cthe surface of last scatter.\u201d That shell,\nwhich formed during a period of about a hundred thousand years, marks the epoch when almost all the\natoms in the cosmos were born.\nBy then, matter in large regions of the universe had already begun to coalesce. Where matter\naccumulates, gravity grows stronger, enabling more and more matter to gather. Those matter-rich\nregions seeded the formation of galaxy superclusters, while other regions remained relatively empty.\nThe photons that last scattered off electrons within the coalescing regions developed a different,\nslightly cooler spectrum as they climbed out of the strengthening gravity field, which robbed them of a\nbit of energy.\nThe CBR indeed shows spots that are slightly hotter or slightly cooler than average, typically by\nabout one hundred-thousandth of a degree. These hot and cool spots mark the earliest structures in the\ncosmos, the first clumping together of matter. We know what matter looks like today because we see\ngalaxies, galaxy clusters, and galaxy superclusters. To figure out how those systems arose, we probe\nthe cosmic background radiation, a remarkable relic from the remote past, still filling the entire\nuniverse. Studying the patterns in the CBR amounts to a kind of cosmic phrenology: we can read the\nbumps on the \u201cskull\u201d of the youthful universe and from them deduce behavior not only for an infant but\nalso for a grown-up.\nBy adding other observations of the local and the distant universe, astronomers can determine all\nkinds of fundamental cosmic properties from the CBR. Compare the distribution of sizes and\ntemperatures of the slightly warmer and cooler areas, for instance, and we can infer the strength of\ngravity in the early universe, and thus how quickly matter accumulated. From that we can then deduce\nhow much ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy the universe comprises (the percentages are\n4, 23, and 73, respectively). From there, it\u2019s easy to tell whether or not the universe will expand\nforever, and whether or not the expansion will slow down or speed up as time passes.\nOrdinary matter is what everyone is made of. It exerts gravity and can absorb, emit, and otherwise\ninteract with light. Dark matter, as we\u2019ll see in Chapter 4, is a substance of unknown nature that\nproduces gravity but does not interact with light in any known way. And dark energy, as we\u2019ll see in\nChapter 5, induces an acceleration of the cosmic expansion, forcing the universe to expand more\nrapidly than it otherwise would. The phrenology exam now says that cosmologists understand how the\nearly universe behaved, but that most of the universe, then and now, consists of stuff they\u2019re clueless\nabout.\nProfound areas of ignorance notwithstanding, today, as never before, cosmology has an anchor.

The Coma cluster, as it is called by those in the know, is an isolated\nand richly populated ensemble of galaxies about 300 million light-years from Earth. Its many\nthousands of galaxies orbit the cluster\u2019s center, moving in all directions like bees circling their hive.\nUsing the motions of a few dozen galaxies as tracers of the gravity field that binds the entire cluster,\nZwicky discovered their average velocity to be shockingly high. Since larger gravitational forces\ninduce higher velocities in the objects that they attract, Zwicky deduced an enormous mass for the\nComa cluster. When we sum up all of its galaxies\u2019 estimated masses, Coma ranks among the largest\nand most massive galaxy clusters in the universe. Even so, the cluster does not contain enough visible\nmatter to account for the observed speeds of its member galaxies. Matter seems to be missing.\nIf you apply Newton\u2019s law of gravity and assume that the cluster does not exist in an odd state of\nexpansion or collapse, you can calculate what the characteristic average speed of its galaxies ought to", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3395, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f38497c0-e714-4655-96a6-1669cfe3d8cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "f38497c0-e714-4655-96a6-1669cfe3d8cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0972905-b8c8-42b3-b961-8b47bab60b57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "462acdebd9efe60286effedebc2271ae5b4a5b8946158f0a2b4141da805a42da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "be. All you need is the size of the cluster and an estimate of its total mass: The mass, acting over\ndistances characterized by the cluster\u2019s size, determines how rapidly the galaxies must move to avoid\nfalling into the cluster\u2019s center or escaping from the cluster entirely.\nIn a similar calculation, as Newton showed, you can derive the speed at which each of the planets at\nits particular distance from the Sun must move in its orbit. Far from being magic, these speeds satisfy\nthe gravitational circumstance in which each planet finds itself. If the Sun suddenly acquired more\nmass, Earth and everything else in the solar system would need larger velocities to stay in their\ncurrent orbits. With too much speed, however, the Sun\u2019s gravity will be insufficient to maintain\neverybody\u2019s orbit. If Earth\u2019s orbital speed were more than the square root of 2 times its current\nspeed, our planet would achieve \u201cescape velocity\u201d and, you guessed it, escape the solar system. We\ncan apply the same reasoning to much larger objects, such as our own Milky Way galaxy, in which\nstars move in orbits that respond to the gravity from all the other stars, or in clusters of galaxies,\nwhere each of the galaxies likewise feels the gravity from all the other galaxies.

The cluster should therefore swiftly fly apart, leaving barely a trace of its beehive\nexistence after just a few hundred million years, perhaps a billion, had passed. But the cluster is more\nthan 10 billion years old, nearly as old as the universe itself. And so was born what remains the\nlongest-standing mystery in astronomy.\nThrough the decades that followed Zwicky\u2019s work, other galaxy clusters revealed the same problem.\nSo Coma could not be blamed for being odd. Then whom should we blame? Newton? No, his\ntheories had been examined for 250 years and passed all tests. Einstein? No. The formidable gravity\nof galaxy clusters does not rise high enough to require the full hammer of Einstein\u2019s general theory of\nrelativity, just two decades old when Zwicky did his research. Perhaps the \u201cmissing mass\u201d needed to\nbind the Coma cluster\u2019s galaxies does exist, but in some unknown, invisible form. For a time,\nastronomers renamed the missing-mass problem the \u201cmissing-light problem,\u201d since the mass had been\nstrongly inferred from the excess of gravity. Today, with better determinations of the masses of galaxy\nclusters, astronomers use the moniker \u201cdark matter,\u201d although \u201cdark gravity\u201d would be more precise.\nThe dark matter\n problem reared its invisible head a second time. In 1976, Vera Rubin, an astrophysicist\nat the Carnegie Institution of Washington, discovered a similar \u201cmissing-mass\u201d anomaly within spiral\ngalaxies themselves.

Using these\nobjects as tracers of the gravity field \u201coutside\u201d the galaxy, where \nvisible matter no longer adds to the\ntotal, Rubin discovered that their orbital speeds, which should have fallen with increasing distance\nout there in Nowheresville, in fact remained high.\nThese largely empty volumes of space\u2014the rural regions of each galaxy\u2014contain too little visible\nmatter to explain the orbital speeds of the tracers. Rubin correctly reasoned that some form of dark\nmatter must lie in these far-out regions, well beyond the visible edge of each spiral galaxy. Indeed,\nthe dark matter forms a kind of halo around the entire galaxy.\nThis halo problem exists under our noses, right in our own Milky Way galaxy. From galaxy to galaxy\nand from cluster to cluster, the discrepancy between the mass in visible objects and the total mass of\nsystems ranges from a factor of just 2 or 3 up to factors of many hundreds. Across the universe, the\nfactor averages to about 6. That is, cosmic dark matter enjoys about six times the mass of all the\nvisible matter.\nOver the past twenty-five years, further research has revealed that most of the dark matter cannot\nconsist of nonluminous ordinary matter. This conclusion rests on two lines of reasoning. First, we can\neliminate with near certainty all plausible familiar candidates, like the suspects in a police lineup:\nCould the dark matter reside in black holes? No, we think that we would have detected this many\nblack holes from their gravitational effects on nearby stars. Could it be dark clouds? No, they would\nabsorb or otherwise interact with light from stars behind them, which real dark matter doesn\u2019t do.\nCould it be interstellar (or intergalactic) planets, asteroids, and comets, all of which produce no light\nof their own? It\u2019s hard to believe that the universe would manufacture six times as much mass in\nplanets as in stars. That would mean six thousand Jupiters for every star in the galaxy, or worse yet, 2\nmillion Earths. In our own solar system, for example, everything that is not the Sun adds to a paltry\n0.2 percent of the Sun\u2019s mass.\nThus, as best we can figure, the dark matter doesn\u2019t simply consist of matter that happens to be dark.\nInstead, it\u2019s something else altogether. Dark matter exerts gravity according to the same rules that\nordinary matter follows, but it does little else that might allow us to detect it. Of course, we are\nhamstrung in this analysis by not knowing what the dark matter is. The difficulties of detecting dark\nmatter, intimately connected with our difficulties in perceiving what it might be, raise the question: If\nall matter has mass, and all mass has gravity, does all gravity have matter? We don\u2019t know. The name\n\u201cdark matter\u201d presupposes the existence of a kind of matter that has gravity and that we don\u2019t yet\nunderstand. But maybe it\u2019s the gravity that we don\u2019t understand.\nTo study dark matter beyond deducing its existence, astrophysicists now seek to learn where the\nstuff collects in space. If dark matter existed only at the outer edges of galaxy clusters, for example,\nthen the galaxies\u2019 velocities would show no evidence of a dark matter problem, because the galaxies\u2019\nspeeds and trajectories respond only to sources of gravity interior to their orbits. If the dark matter\noccupied only the clusters\u2019 centers, then the run of galaxy speeds as measured from the center of the\ncluster out to its edge would respond to ordinary matter alone. But the speeds of galaxies in clusters\nreveal that the dark matter permeates the entire volume occupied by the orbiting galaxies.

For the smallest objects, such as moons and planets, no discrepancy exists. Earth\u2019s surface\ngravity, for example, can be explained entirely by what\u2019s under our feet. So if you are overweight on\nEarth, don\u2019t blame dark matter. Dark matter also has no bearing on the Moon\u2019s orbit around Earth, nor\non the movements of the planets around the Sun. But we do need it to explain the motions of stars\naround the center of the galaxy.\nDoes a different kind of gravitational physics operate on the galactic scale? Probably not.

Otherwise, we would find that one in every six pieces of dark\nmatter has a chunk of ordinary matter clinging to it. So far as we can tell, that\u2019s not the way things are.\nAt the risk of inducing depression, astrophysicists sometimes argue that all the matter that we have\ncome to know and love in the universe\u2014the stuff of stars, planets, and life\u2014are mere buoys afloat in\na vast cosmic ocean of something that looks like nothing.\nBut what if this conclusion were entirely wrong? When nothing else seems to work, some scientists\nwill understandably, and quite rightly, question the fundamental laws of physics that underlies the\nassumptions made by others who seek to understand the universe.\nDuring the early 1980s, the Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom of the Weizmann Institute of Science\nin Rehovot, Israel, suggested a change in Newton\u2019s laws of gravity, a theory now known as MOND\n(MOdified Newtonian Dynamics). Accepting the fact that standard Newtonian dynamics operates\nsuccessfully on size scales smaller than galaxies, Milgrom suggested that Newton needed some help\nin describing gravity\u2019s effects at distances the sizes of galaxies and galaxy clusters, within which\nindividual stars and star clusters are so far apart that they exert relatively little gravitational force on\neach other. Milgrom added an extra term to Newton\u2019s equation, specifically tailored to come to life at\nastronomically large distances. Although he invented MOND as a computational tool, Milgrom didn\u2019t\nrule out the possibility that his theory could refer to a new phenomenon of nature.\nMOND has had only limited success. The theory can account for the movement of isolated objects in\nthe outer reaches of many spiral galaxies, but it raises more questions than it answers. MOND fails to\npredict reliably the dynamics of more complex configurations, such as the movement of galaxies in\nbinary and multiple systems. Furthermore, the detailed map of the cosmic background radiation\nproduced by the WMAP satellite in 2003 allowed cosmologists to isolate and measure the influence\nof dark matter in the early universe. Because these results appear to correspond to a consistent model\nof the cosmos based on conventional theories of gravity, MOND has lost many adherents.\nDuring the first half million years after the big bang, a mere moment in the 14-billion-year sweep of", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3808, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "918e139d-e91d-417d-960b-ca7a23c23a10": {"__data__": {"id_": "918e139d-e91d-417d-960b-ca7a23c23a10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83b22123-fa0d-4379-bb4e-9ce32900a73a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "839dd7253937abb06d9c14e69c26e8e756da43130fe9770d6d35b0acb1fe362e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "cosmic history, matter in the universe had already begun to coalesce into the blobs that would become\nclusters and superclusters of galaxies.

It needed the help of\ndark matter, without which we would be living\u2014actually not living\u2014in a universe with no structure:\nno clusters, no galaxies, no stars, no planets, no people. How much gravity from dark matter did it\nneed? Six times as much as that provided by ordinary matter itself. This analysis leaves no room for\nMOND\u2019s little corrective terms in Newton\u2019s laws. The analysis doesn\u2019t tell us what dark matter is,\nonly that dark matter\u2019s effects are real\u2014and that, try as you may, you cannot credit ordinary matter for\nit.\nDark matter plays another crucial role in the universe. To appreciate all that the dark matter has\ndone for us, go back in time to a couple of minutes after the big bang, when the universe was still so\nimmensely hot and dense that hydrogen nuclei (protons) could fuse together. This crucible of the early\ncosmos forged hydrogen into helium, along with trace amounts of lithium, plus an even smaller\namount of deuterium, which is a heavier version of the hydrogen nucleus, with a neutron added to the\nproton. This mixture of nuclei provides another cosmic fingerprint of the big bang, a relic that allows\nus to reconstruct what happened when the cosmos was a few minutes old. In creating this fingerprint,\nthe prime mover was the strong nuclear force\u2014the force that binds protons and neutrons within the\nnucleus\u2014and not gravity, a force so weak that it gains significance only as particles assemble\nthemselves by the trillions.\nBy the time the temperature dropped below a threshold value, nuclear fusion throughout the universe\nhad made one helium nucleus for every ten hydrogen nuclei. The universe had also turned about one\npart in a thousand of its ordinary matter into lithium nuclei, and two parts in a hundred thousand into\ndeuterium. If dark matter did not consist of some noninteracting substance but was instead made of\ndark ordinary matter\u2014matter with normal fusion privileges\u2014then because the dark matter packed six\ntimes as many particles into the tiny volumes of the early universe as ordinary matter did, its presence\nwould have dramatically increased the fusion rate of hydrogen. The result would have been a\nnoticeable overproduction of helium, in comparison with the observed amount, and the birth of a\nuniverse notably different to the one that we inhabit.\nHelium is one tough nucleus, relatively easy to make but extremely difficult to fuse into other nuclei.\nBecause stars have continued to make helium from hydrogen in their cores, while destroying\nrelatively little helium through more advanced nuclear fusion, we may expect that the places where\nwe find the lowest amounts of helium in the universe should have no less helium than what the\nuniverse produced during its first few minutes. Sure enough, galaxies whose stars have only\nminimally processed their ingredients show that one in ten of their atoms consists of helium, just as\nyou would expect from the big bang birthday suit of the cosmos, so long as the dark matter then\npresent did not participate in the nuclear fusion that created nuclei.\nSo, dark matter\n is our friend.

The light side embraces all familiar\nheavenly objects\u2014the stars, which group by the billions into galaxies, as well as the planets and\nsmaller cosmic debris that may not produce visible light but do emit other forms of electromagnetic\nradiation, such as infrared or radio waves.\nWe have discovered that the dark side of the universe embraces the puzzling dark matter, detected\nonly by its gravitational influence on visible matter but otherwise of completely unknown form and\ncomposition. A modest amount of this dark matter may be ordinary matter that remains invisible\nbecause it produces no detectable radiation. But, as detailed in the previous chapter, the great bulk of\nthe dark matter must consist of non-ordinary matter, whose nature continues to elude us\u2014except for\nits gravitational force on matter we can see.\nBeyond all issues concerning dark matter, the dark side of the universe has another, entirely different\naspect. One that resides not in matter of any kind, but in space itself. We owe this concept, along with\nthe amazing results that it implies, to the father of modern cosmology, none other than Albert Einstein\nhimself.\nNinety years ago, while the newly perfected machine guns of World War I slaughtered soldiers by\nthe thousands a few hundred miles to the west, Albert Einstein sat in his office in Berlin, pondering\nthe universe. As the war began, Einstein and a colleague had circulated an antiwar petition among his\npeers, gathering two other signatures in addition to their own. This act set him apart from his fellow\nscientists, most of whom had signed an appeal to aid Germany\u2019s war effort, and ruined his\ncolleague\u2019s career. But Einstein\u2019s engaging personality and scientific fame allowed him to keep the\nesteem of his peers. He continued his efforts to find equations that could accurately describe the\ncosmos.\nBefore the war ended, Einstein achieved success\u2014arguably his greatest of all. In November 1915,\nhe produced his general theory of relativity, which describes how space and matter interact: Matter\ntells space how to bend, and space tells matter how to move. To replace Isaac Newton\u2019s mysterious\n\u201caction at a distance,\u201d Einstein viewed gravity as a local warp in the fabric of space. The Sun, for\nexample, creates a sort of dimple, bending space most noticeably at distances closest to it. The\nplanets tend to roll into this dimple, but their inertia keeps them from falling all the way in. Instead,\nthey move in orbits around the Sun that keep them at a nearly constant distance from the dimple in\nspace. Within a few weeks after Einstein published his theory, the physicist Karl Schwarzschild,\ndiverting himself from the horrors of life in the German army (which gave him a fatal disease soon\nafterward), used Einstein\u2019s concept to demonstrate that an object with sufficiently strong gravity will\ncreate a \u201csingularity\u201d in space.

Studying this equation in the privacy of his office,\ncreating models of the cosmos in his mind, Einstein almost discovered the expanding universe, a\ndozen years before Edwin Hubble\u2019s observations revealed it.\nEinstein\u2019s basic equation predicts that in a universe in which matter has a roughly even distribution,\nspace cannot be \u201cstatic.\u201d The cosmos cannot just \u201csit there,\u201d as our intuition insists that it should, and\nas all astronomical observations until that time implied. Instead, the totality of space must always be\neither expanding or contracting: space must behave something like the surface of an inflating or\ndeflating balloon, but never like the surface of a balloon with constant size.\nThis worried Einstein. For once, this bold theorist, who mistrusted authority and had never hesitated\nto oppose conventional physics ideas, felt that he had gone too far. No astronomical observations\nsuggested an expanding universe, because astronomers had only documented the motions of nearby\nstars and had not yet determined the faraway distances to what we now call galaxies. Rather than\nannouncing to the world that the universe must either be expanding or contracting, Einstein returned to\nhis equation, seeking a way to immobilize the cosmos.\nHe soon found one. Einstein\u2019s basic equation allowed for a term with a constant but unknown value\nthat represents the amount of energy contained in every cubic centimeter of empty space. Because\nnothing suggested that this constant term should have one value or another, in his first pass Einstein\nhad set it equal to zero. Now Einstein published a scientific article to demonstrate that if this constant\nterm, which cosmologists later named the \u201ccosmological constant,\u201d had a particular value, then space\ncould be static. Then theory would no longer conflict with observations of the universe, and Einstein\ncould regard his equation as valid.\nEinstein\u2019s solution encountered grave difficulties. In 1922, a Russian mathematician named\nAlexander Friedmann proved that Einstein\u2019s static universe must be unstable, like a pencil balanced\non its point. The slightest ripple or disturbance would cause space either to expand or to contract.\nEinstein first proclaimed Friedmann mistaken, but then, in a generous act typical of the man,\npublished an article retracting that claim and pronouncing Friedmann correct after all. As the 1920s\nended, Einstein was delighted to learn of Hubble\u2019s discovery that the universe is expanding.\nAccording to George Gamow\u2019s recollections, Einstein pronounced the cosmological constant his\n\u201cgreatest blunder.\u201d Except for a few cosmologists who continued to invoke a non-zero cosmological\nconstant (with a value different from the one that Einstein had used) to explain certain puzzling\nobservations, most of which later proved to be incorrect, scientists the world over sighed with relief\nthat space had proven to have no need of this constant.\nOr so they thought. The great cosmological story at the end of the twentieth century, the surprise that\nstood the world of cosmology on one ear and sang a different tune into the other, resides in the\nstunning discovery, first announced in 1998, that the universe does have a non-zero cosmological\nconstant.

Zero curvature describes \u201cflat\nspace,\u201d the kind that our minds insist on as the only possibility, which extends to infinity in all\ndirections, like the surface of an infinite chalkboard. In contrast, a positively curved space\ncorresponds in analogy to the surface of a sphere, a two-dimensional space whose curvature we can\nsee by using the third dimension. Notice that the center of the sphere, the point that appears to remain\nstationary as its two-dimensional surface expands or contracts, resides in this third dimension and\nappears nowhere on the surface that represents all of space.\nJust as all positively curved surfaces include only a finite amount of area, all positively curved\nspaces contain only a finite amount of volume. A positively curved cosmos has the property that if you\njourney outward from Earth for a sufficiently long time, you will eventually return to your point of\norigin, like Magellan circumnavigating our globe. Unlike positively curved spherical surfaces,\nnegatively curved spaces extend to infinity, even though they are not flat. A negatively curved two-\ndimensional surface resembles the surface of an infinitely large saddle: it curves \u201cupward\u201d in one\ndirection (front to back) and \u201cdownward\u201d in another (side to side).\nIf the cosmological\n constant equals zero, we can describe the overall properties of the universe with just\ntwo numbers. One of these, called the Hubble constant, measures the rate at which the universe is\nexpanding now. The other measures the curvature of space. During the second half of the twentieth\ncentury, almost all cosmologists believed that the cosmological constant was zero, and saw measuring\nthe cosmic expansion rate and the curvature of space as their primary research agenda.\nBoth of these numbers can be found from accurate measurements of the speeds at which objects\nlocated at different distances are receding from us. The overall trend between distance and velocity\n\u2014the rate at which the recession velocities of galaxies increase with increasing distance\u2014yields the\nHubble constant, whereas small deviations from this general trend, which appear only when we\nobserve objects at the greatest distances from us, will reveal the curvature of space. Whenever\nastronomers observe objects many billion light-years from the Milky Way, they look so far back in\ntime that they see the cosmos not as it is now but as it was when significantly less time had elapsed\nsince the big bang. Observations of galaxies located 5 billion or more light-years from the Milky Way\nallow cosmologists to reconstruct a significant part of the history of the expanding universe. In\nparticular, they can see how the rate of expansion has changed with time\u2014the key to determining the\ncurvature of space. This approach works, at least in principle, because the amount of space\u2019s\ncurvature induces subtle differences in the rate at which the universal expansion had changed through\npast billions of years.\nIn practice, astrophysicists remained unable to fulfill this program, because they could not make\nsufficiently reliable estimates of the distances to galaxy clusters many billion light-years from Earth.\nThey had another arrow in their quiver, however.

Exact equality of\nthe actual and critical values of the density occurs in a cosmos with zero curvature, whereas in a\nnegatively curved universe, the actual density is less than the critical density.\nBy the mid-1990s, cosmologists knew that even after including all the dark matter they had detected\n(from its gravitational influence on visible matter), the total density of matter in the universe only\ncame to about one quarter of the critical density. This result hardly seems astounding, although it does\nimply that the cosmos will never cease expanding, and that the space in which all of us live must be\nnegatively curved. It hurt theoretically oriented cosmologists, however, because they had come to\nbelieve that space must have zero curvature.\nThis belief rested\n on the \u201cinflationary model\u201d of the universe, named (unsurprisingly) at a time of a\nsteeply rising consumer price index. In 1979, Alan Guth, a physicist working at the Stanford Linear\nAccelerator Center in California, hypothesized that during its earliest moments, the cosmos expanded\nat an incredibly rapid rate\u2014so rapidly that different bits of matter accelerated away from one\nanother, reaching speeds far greater than the speed of light. But doesn\u2019t Einstein\u2019s theory of special\nrelativity make the speed of light a universal speed limit for all motion? Not exactly. Einstein\u2019s limit\napplies only to objects moving within space and not the expansion of space itself. During the\n\u201cinflationary epoch,\u201d which lasted only from about 10\n-37\n second to 10\n-34\n second after the big bang,\nthe cosmos expanded by a factor of about 10\n50\n.\nWhat produced this enormous cosmic expansion? Guth speculated that all of space must have\nundergone a \u201cphase transition,\u201d something analogous to what happens when liquid water quickly\nfreezes into ice. After some crucial tweaking by his colleagues in the Soviet Union, the United\nKingdom, and the United States, Guth\u2019s idea became so attractive that it has dominated theoretical\nmodels of the extremely early universe for two decades.\nAnd what makes inflation such an attractive theory? The inflationary era explains why the universe,\nin its overall properties, looks the same in all directions: everything that we can see (and a good deal\nmore than that) inflated from a single tiny region of space, converting its local properties into\nuniversal ones. Other advantages, which need not detain us here, accrue to the theory, at least among\nthose who create model universes in their minds. One additional feature deserves emphasis, however.\nThe inflationary model makes a straightforward, testable prediction: space in the universe should be\nflat, neither positively nor negatively curved, but just as flat as our intuition imagines it.\nAccording to this theory, the flatness of space arises from the enormous expansion that occurred\nduring the inflationary epoch. Picture yourself, in analogy, on the surface of a balloon, and let the\nballoon expand by a factor so large that you lose track of the zeros. After this expansion, the part of\nthe balloon\u2019s surface that you can see will be flat as a pancake.

Their\nbeliefs carried them buoyantly onward, even as observationally oriented cosmologists mocked their\noverreliance on theoretical analysis. And then the mocking stopped.\nIn 1998, two\n rival teams of astronomers announced new observations implying the existence of a non-\nzero cosmological constant\u2014not (of course) the very number that Einstein had proposed in order to\nkeep the universe static, but another, quite different value, one that implies that the universe will\nexpand forever at an ever-increasing rate.\nIf theorists had proposed this for yet another model universe, the world would have little noted nor\nlong remembered their effort.

If the two are equal, space\nmust be flat.

The resulting explosion\u2014similar in concept to a hydrogen bomb but trillions\nof times more violent\u2014blows the white dwarf completely apart and produces a Type Ia supernova.\nSN Ia\u2019s have proven particularly useful to astronomers by possessing two separate qualities. First,\nthey produce the most luminous supernova explosions in the cosmos, visible across billions of light-\nyears. Second, nature sets a limit to the maximum mass that any white dwarf can have, equal to about\n1.4 times the Sun\u2019s mass. Matter can accumulate on a white dwarf\u2019s surface only until the white\ndwarf\u2019s mass reaches this limiting value. At that point, nuclear fusion blasts the white dwarf apart\u2014\nand the blast occurs in objects with the same mass and the same composition, strewn throughout the\nuniverse. As a result, all of these white dwarf supernovae attain nearly the same maximum energy\noutput, and they all fade away at almost the same rate after they achieve their maximum brightness.\nThese dual attributes allow SN Ia\u2019s to provide astronomers with highly luminous, easily\nrecognizable \u201cstandard candles,\u201d objects known to achieve the same maximum energy output\nwherever they appear.

If one has twice the distance of the other, it\nwill attain only one quarter of the other\u2019s maximum apparent brightness, because the brightness with\nwhich any object appears to us diminishes in proportion to the square of its distance.\nOnce astronomers learned how to recognize Type Ia supernovae, based on their detailed study of the\nspectrum of light from each of these objects, they had a golden key with which to unlock the riddle of\ndetermining accurate distance. After measuring (through other means) the distances to the closest of\nthe SN Ia\u2019s, they could estimate much greater distances to other Type Ia supernovae, simply by\ncomparing the brightnesses of the relatively near and distant objects.\nThroughout the 1990s, two teams of supernova specialists, one centered at Harvard and the other at\nthe University of California at Berkeley, refined this technique by finding how to compensate for the\nsmall but real differences among the SN Ia\u2019s, which the supernovae reveal to us through the details in\ntheir spectra. In order to use their newly forged key to unlock the distances to faraway supernovae,\nthe researchers needed a telescope capable of observing distant galaxies with exquisite precision,\nand they found one in the Hubble Space Telescope, refurbished in 1993 to correct its primary mirror\nthat had been ground to the wrong shape. The supernova experts used ground-based telescopes to\ndiscover dozens of SN Ia\u2019s in galaxies billions of light-years from the Milky Way. They then arranged\nfor the Hubble Telescope, for which they could obtain only a modest fraction of the total observing\ntime, to study these newfound supernovae in detail.\nAs the 1990s drew toward a close, the two teams of supernova observers competed keenly to\nderive a new and expanded \u201cHubble diagram,\u201d the key graph in cosmology that plots galaxies\u2019\ndistances versus the speeds at which the galaxies are moving away from us.

The direct proportionality between galaxies\u2019 distances\nand recession velocities finds algebraic expression in Hubble\u2019s law, the simple equation that\ndescribes the basic behavior of the universe: \nv = H\no\n \nx\n d\n. Here \nv\n stands for recession velocity, \nd\n for\ndistance, and \nH\no\n is a universal constant, called Hubble\u2019s constant, that describes the entire universe\nat any particular time. Alien observers throughout the universe, studying the cosmos 14 billion years\nafter the big bang, will find galaxies receding at speeds that follow Hubble\u2019s law, and all of them will\nderive the same value for Hubble\u2019s constant, though they will probably give it a different name. This\nassumption of cosmic democracy underlies all of modern cosmology. We cannot prove that the entire\ncosmos follows this democratic principle. Perhaps, far beyond the farthest horizon of our vision, the\ncosmos behaves quite differently from what we see. But cosmologists reject this approach, at least\nfor the observable universe. In that case, \nv = H\no\n \nx\n d\n represents universal law.\nWith time, however, the value of Hubble\u2019s constant can and does change.

The latter value\nwould be revealed by the details of the upper reaches of the graph, whose points describe the most\ndistant galaxies ever observed. Thus a Hubble diagram extending to distances of many billion light-\nyears would reveal the history of the expansion of the cosmos, embodied in its changing rate of\nexpansion.\nIn striving for this goal, the astrophysics community struck a mother lode of good fortune in having\ntwo competing teams of supernova observers. The supernova results, first announced in February\n1998, had an impact so great that no single group could have survived the natural skepticism of\ncosmologists to the overthrow of their widely accepted models of the universe. Because the two\nobserving teams directed their skepticism primarily at each other, they brilliantly searched for errors\nin the other team\u2019s data or interpretation.

Just that the most distant SN Ia\u2019s turned out a bit fainter than expected. This\nimplies that the supernovae are somewhat farther away than they ought to be, which in turn shows that\nsomething made the universe expand a bit more rapidly than it should.

The only culprit that fits the facts is the \u201cdark energy\u201d that lurks in empty space\u2014the\nenergy whose existence corresponds to a non-zero value for the cosmological constant.

Cosmologists express the densities of matter and\ndark energy with the symbols \n\u03a9\nM\n and \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n, where \n\u03a9\n (the Greek capital letter omega) stands for the\nratio of the cosmic density to the critical density. \n\u03a9\nM\n represents the ratio of the average density of all\nthe matter in the universe to the critical density, while \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n stands for the ratio of the density\nequivalent provided by the dark energy to the critical density.

In a flat universe, which has zero curvature of space, the sum of\n\u03a9\nM\n and \n\u03a9\n\u039b\nalways equals 1, because the total density (of actual matter plus the matter equivalent\nprovided by the dark energy) exactly equals the critical density.\nThe observations of distant Type Ia supernovae measure the difference between \n\u03a9\nM\n and \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n.\nMatter tends to slow the expansion of the universe, as gravity pulls everything toward everything else.\nThe greater the density of matter, the more this pull will slow things down. Dark energy, however,\ndoes something quite different. Unlike pieces of matter, whose mutual attraction slows the cosmic\nexpansion, dark energy has a strange property: it tends to make space expand, and thus accelerate the\nexpansion. As space expands, more dark energy comes into existence, so that the expanding universe\nrepresents the ultimate free lunch. The new dark energy tends to make the cosmos expand still faster,\nso the free lunch grows ever larger as time goes on. The value of \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n is a measure of the size of the\ncosmological constant and gives us the magnitude of dark energy\u2019s expansionist ways. When\nastronomers measured the relationship between galaxies\u2019 distances and their recession velocities,\nthey found the result of the contest between gravity\u2019s pulling things together and dark energy\u2019s pushing\nthem apart. Their measurements implied that \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n \n\u2013 \n\u03a9\nM\n = \n0.46, plus or minus about 0.03. Since\nastronomers had already determined that \n\u03a9\nM\n equals approximately 0.25, this result sets \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n \nat about\n0.71. Then the sum of \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n and \n\u03a9\nM\n rises to \n0.96, near the total predicted by the inflationary model.\nRecent new results have sharpened these values and brought this sum even closer to 1.\nDespite the agreement between the two competing groups of supernova experts, some cosmologists\nremained cautious.

WMAP\u2019s whole-sky map provided the capstone to the mapping\neffort, and has determined, once and for all, the most important features of the cosmic background\nradiation.\nThe most striking and significant aspect of this map, as was also true for the balloon-borne\nobservations and for WMAP\u2019s predecessor, the COBE (COsmic Background Explorer) satellite, lies\nin its near featurelessness. No measurable differences in the intensity of the cosmic background\nradiation arriving from all different directions appear until we reach a precision of about one part in\na thousand in our measurements. Even then, the only discernible differences appear as a slightly\ngreater intensity, centered on one particular direction, that matches a corresponding slightly lesser\nintensity, centered on the opposite direction. These differences arise from our Milky Way galaxy\u2019s\nmotion among its neighbor galaxies. The Doppler effect causes us to receive slightly stronger\nradiation from the direction of this motion, not because the radiation actually is stronger, but because\nour motion toward the cosmic background radiation (CBR) slightly increases the energies of the\nphotons that we detect.\nOnce we compensate for the Doppler effect, the cosmic background radiation appears perfectly\nsmooth\u2014until we attain an even higher precision of about one part in a hundred thousand. At that\nlevel, tiny deviations from total smoothness appear. They track locations from which the CBR arrives\nwith a bit more, or a bit less, intensity. As previously noted, the differences in intensity mark\ndirections in which matter was either a little hotter and denser, or a little cooler and more rarefied,\nthan the average value 380,000 years after the big bang. The COBE satellite first saw these\ndifferences; balloon-borne instruments and South Pole observations improved our measurements; and\nthen the WMAP satellite provided still better precision in surveying the entire sky, allowing\ncosmologists to construct a detailed map of the intensity of the cosmic background radiation,\nobserved with unprecedented angular resolution of about one degree.\nThe tiny deviations from smoothness revealed by COBE and WMAP have more than passing interest\nto cosmologists. First of all, they show the seeds of structure in the universe at the time when the\ncosmic background radiation ceased to interact with matter. The regions revealed as slightly denser\nthan average at that time had a head start toward further contraction, and have won the competition to\nacquire the most matter by gravity. Thus the primary result from the new map of the CBR\u2019s intensity in\ndifferent directions is the verification of cosmologists\u2019 theories of how the immense differences in\ndensity from place to place throughout the cosmos that we see now owe their existence to tiny\ndifferences in density that existed a few hundred thousand years after the big bang.\nBut cosmologists can use their new observations of the cosmic background radiation to discern\nanother, still more basic fact about the cosmos. The details in the map of the CBR\u2019s intensity from\nplace to place reveal the curvature of space itself. This amazing result rests on the fact that the\ncurvature of space affects how radiation travels through it. If, for example, space has a positive\ncurvature, then when we observe the cosmic background radiation, we are in much the same situation\nas an observer at the North Pole who looks along Earth\u2019s surface to study radiation produced near the\nEquator.

This represents the maximum distance at which particles could\nhave affected one another to produce any irregularities. At greater distances, the \u201cnews\u201d from other\nparticles would not yet have arrived, so they cannot be blamed for any deviations from smoothness.\nHow large an angle would these maximum deviations span on the sky now?

Observations of the cosmic background radiation therefore offer a direct measurement\nof \n\u03a9\nM\n + \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n, in contrast to the supernova observations, which measure the difference between \n\u03a9\nM\nand \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n.\nThe WMAP data show that the largest deviations from smoothness in the CBR span an angle of\nabout 1 degree, which implies that \n\u03a9\nM\n + \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n has a value of 1.02, plus or minus 0.02. Thus, within\nthe limits of experimental accuracy, we may conclude that \n\u03a9\nM\n + \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n = \n1, and that space is flat.

As already noted, these are the astrophysicists\u2019 current\nbest estimates for the values of these two key cosmic parameters, which tell us that matter\u2014both\nordinary and dark\u2014provides 27 percent of the total energy density in the universe, and dark energy\n73 percent. (If we prefer to think of energy\u2019s mass equivalent, E/c\n2\n, then dark energy furnishes 73\npercent of all the mass.)\nCosmologists have long known that if the universe has a non-zero cosmological constant, the\nrelative influence of matter and dark energy must change significantly as time passes. On the other\nhand, a flat universe remains flat forever, from its origin in the big bang to the infinite future that\nawaits us. In a flat universe, the sum of \n\u03a9\nM\n and \n\u03a9\n\u039b\n always equals 1, so if one of these changes, the\nother must also vary in compensation.\nDuring the cosmic epochs that followed soon after the big bang, the dark energy produced hardly\nany effect on the universe.

In those bygone\nages, the universe behaved in much the same way as a cosmos without a cosmological constant.

And why does that acceleration have the particular value that now\ncharacterizes the cosmos?\nThe simple answer to the first question assigns all responsibility for the acceleration to the\nexistence of dark energy, or, equivalently, to a non-zero cosmological constant. The amount of\nacceleration depends directly on the amount of dark energy per cubic centimeter: More energy\nimplies greater acceleration. Thus, if cosmologists could only explain where the dark energy comes\nfrom, and why it exists in the amount that they find today, they could claim to have uncovered a\nfundamental secret of the universe\u2014the explanation for the cosmic \u201cfree lunch,\u201d the energy in empty\nspace that continuously drives the cosmos toward an eternal, ever more rapid expansion and a far\nfuture of enormous amounts of space, correspondingly enormous amounts of dark energy, and almost\nno matter per cubic light-year.\nWhat makes dark energy? From the deep realms of particle physics, cosmologists can produce an\nanswer: The dark energy arises from events that must occur in empty space, if we trust what we have\nlearned from the quantum theory of matter and energy. All of particle physics rests on this theory,\nwhich has been verified so often and so exactly in the submicroscopic realm that almost all physicists\naccept it as correct. An integral part of quantum theory implies that what we call empty space in fact\nbuzzes with \u201cvirtual particles,\u201d which wink into and out of existence so rapidly that we can never pin\nthem down directly, but can only observe their effects. The continual appearance and disappearance\nof these virtual particles, called the \u201cquantum fluctuations of the vacuum\u201d by those who like a good\nphysics phrase, gives energy to empty space. Furthermore, particle physicists can, without much\ndifficulty, calculate the amount of energy that resides in every cubic centimeter of the vacuum. The\nstraightforward application of quantum theory to what we call a vacuum predicts that quantum\nfluctuations must create dark energy.

If real\nempty space contained dark energy in anything like the amounts proposed by particle physics, the\nuniverse would have long since puffed itself into so large a volume that our heads could never have\nbegun to spin, since a tiny fraction of a second would have sufficed to spread matter out to\nunimaginable rarefaction. Theory and observation agree that empty space ought to contain dark\nenergy, but they disagree by a trillion to the tenth power about the amount of that energy. No earthly\nanalogy, nor even a cosmic one, can illustrate this discrepancy accurately. The distance to the farthest\ngalaxy that we know exceeds the size of a proton by a factor of 10\n40\n. Even this enormous number is\nonly the cube root of the factor by which theory and observation currently diverge concerning the\nvalue of the cosmological constant.\nParticle physicists and cosmologists have long known that quantum theory predicts an unacceptably\nlarge value for the dark energy, but in the days when the cosmological constant was thought to be\nzero, they hoped to discover some explanation that would, in effect, cancel positive with negative\nterms in the theory and thereby finesse the problem out of existence. A similar cancellation once\nsolved the problem of how much energy virtual particles contribute to the particles that we do\nobserve. Now that the cosmological constant turns out to be non-zero, the hopes of finding such a\ncancellation seem dimmer. If the cancellation does exist, it must somehow remove almost all of the\nmammoth theoretical value we have today. For now, lacking any good explanation for the size of the\ncosmological constant, cosmologists must continue to collaborate with particle physicists as they seek\nto reconcile theories of how the cosmos generates dark energy with the value observed for the amount\nof dark energy per cubic centimeter.\nSome of the finest minds engaged in cosmology and particle physics have directed much of their\nenergy toward explaining this observational value, with no success at all. This provokes fire, and\nsometimes ire, among theorists, in part because they know that a Nobel Prize\u2014not to mention the\nimmense joy of discovery\u2014awaits those who can explain what nature has done to make space as we\nfind it.

During the first billion years after the big bang, \u03a9\nM\n was\nalmost precisely equal to 1, while \u03a9\n\u039b\n \nwas essentially zero.

So what\u2019s the problem? From an astronomical viewpoint, this stretch of time amounts\nto nearly nothing. Astronomers often take a logarithmic approach to time, dividing it into intervals that\nincrease by factors of 10. First the cosmos had some age; then it grew ten times older; then ten times\nolder than that; and so on toward infinite time, which requires an infinite number of ten-times jumps.\nSuppose that we start counting time at the earliest moment after the big bang that has any significance\nin quantum theory, 10\n-43\n second after the big bang. Since each year contains about 30 million (3 x\n10\n7\n) seconds, we need about 60 factors of 10 to pass from 10\n-43\n second to 3 billion years after the\nbig bang. In contrast, we require only a bit more than a single factor of 10 to stroll from 3 billion to\n50 billion years, the only period when \u03a9\nM\n and \u03a9\n\u039b\n are roughly equal. After that, an infinite number\nof ten-times factors opens the way to the infinite future. From this logarithmic perspective, only a\nvanishingly small probability exists that we should find ourselves living in a cosmic situation for\nwhich \u03a9\nM\n and \u03a9\n\u039b\n have even vaguely similar values. Michael Turner, a leading American\ncosmologist, has termed this conundrum\u2014the question of why we find ourselves alive at a time when\n\u03a9\nM\n and \u03a9\n\u039b\n are approximately equal\u2014the \u201cNancy Kerrigan problem\u201d in honor of the Olympic figure\nskater, who asked, after enduring an assault by her rival\u2019s boyfriend, \u201cWhy me? Why now?\u201d\nDespite their inability to calculate a cosmological constant whose value comes anywhere close to\nthe measure one, cosmologists do have an answer to the Kerrigan problem, but they differ sharply on\nits significance and implications. Some embrace it; some accept it only reluctantly; some dance\naround it; and some despise it. This explanation links the value of the cosmological constant to the\nfact that we are here, alive on a planet that orbits an average star in an average galaxy. Because we\nexist, this argument runs, the parameters that describe the cosmos, and in particular the value of the\ncosmological constant, must have values that allow us to exist.\nConsider, for example, what would happen in a universe with a cosmological constant much larger\nthan its actual value. A much greater amount of dark energy would make \u03a9\n\u039b\n rise far above \u03a9\nM,\n not\nafter about 50 billion years but after only a few million years. By this time, in a cosmos dominated by\nthe accelerating effects of dark energy, matter would spread so rapidly apart that no galaxies, stars, or\nplanets could form. If we assume that the stretch of time from the first formation of clumps of matter to\nthe origin and development of life covers at least 1 billion years, we can conclude that our existence\nlimits the cosmological constant to a value between zero and a few times its actual value, while\nruling out of play the infinite range of higher values.\nThis argument gains more traction if we assume, as do many cosmologists, that everything we call\nthe universe belongs to a much larger \u201cmultiverse,\u201d which contains an infinite number of universes,\nnone of which interact with any other: in the multiverse concept, the entire state of affairs embeds in\nhigher dimensions, so space in our universe remains completely inaccessible to any other universe,\nand vice versa.

Only a tiny, perhaps an\ninfinitesimal fraction of all the universes in the multiverse offer conditions that allow life to exist,\nbecause only this fraction have parameters that permit matter to organize itself into galaxies, stars,\nand planets, and for those objects to last for billions of years.\nCosmologists call this approach to explaining the value of the cosmological constant the anthropic\nprinciple, though the anthropic approach probably offers a better name. This approach toward\nexplaining a crucial question in cosmology has one great appeal: people love it or hate it, but rarely\nfeel neutral about it. Like many intriguing ideas, the anthropic approach can be bent to favor, or at\nleast seem to favor, various theological and teleological mental edifices. Some religious\nfundamentalists find that the anthropic approach supports their beliefs because it implies a central\nrole for humanity: without someone to observe it, the cosmos\u2014at least the cosmos that we know\u2014\nwould not, could not, be here; hence a higher power must have made things just right for us. An\nopponent of this conclusion would note this is not really what the anthropic approach implies; on a\ntheological level, this argument for the existence of God implies surely the most wasteful creator one\nmight imagine, who makes countless universes in order that in a tiny sector of just one of these, life\nmight arise. Why not skip the middleman and follow older creation myths that center on humanity?\nOn the other hand, if you choose to see God in everything, as Spinoza did, you cannot help but\nadmire a multiverse that effloresces universes without end. Like most news from the frontier of\nscience, the concept of a multiverse, and the anthropic approach, can be easily bent in different\ndirections to serve the needs of particular belief systems. As things stand, many cosmologists find the\nmultiverse quite enough to swallow without connecting it to any system of beliefs. Stephen Hawking,\nwho (like Isaac Newton before him) holds the Lucasian chair in astronomy at Cambridge University,\njudges the anthropic approach an excellent resolution of the Kerrigan problem. Stephen Weinberg,\nwho won the Nobel Prize for his insights into particle physics, dislikes this approach but pronounces\nhimself in favor, at least for the time being, because no other reasonable solution has appeared.\nHistory may eventually show that for now, cosmologists are concentrating on the wrong problem\u2014\nwrong in the sense that we don\u2019t yet understand enough to attack it properly. Weinberg likes the\nanalogy with Johannes Kepler\u2019s attempt to explain why the Sun has six planets (as astronomers then\nbelieved), and why they move in the orbits that they do. Four hundred years after Kepler, astronomers\nstill know far too little about the origin of planets to explain the precise number and orbits of the\nSun\u2019s family. We do know that Kepler\u2019s hypothesis, which proposed that the spacing of the planets\u2019\norbits around the Sun allows one of the five perfect solids to fit exactly between each pair of\nadjoining orbits, has no validity whatsoever, because the solids do not fit particularly well, and (even\nmore important) because we have no good reason to explain why the planets\u2019 orbits should obey such\na rule. Later generations may regard today\u2019s cosmologists as latter-day Keplers, struggling valiantly\nto explain what remains inexplicable by today\u2019s understanding of the universe.\nNot everyone favors the anthropic approach.

A theory that appeals to one scientist, typically the one who\nthought it up, may seem ridiculous, or just plain wrong, to another. Both know that theories survive\nand thrive when other scientists find them best at explaining most of the observational data. (As a\nfamous scientist once remarked, Beware of a theory that explains \nall\n the data\u2014some of it will quite\nlikely turn out to be wrong.)\nThe future may not produce a quick resolution to this debate, but it will surely bring forth other\nattempts to explain what we see in the universe. For example, Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University,\nwho could use some tutoring in creating catchy names, has produced a theoretical \u201cekpyrotic model\u201d\nof the cosmos in collaboration with Neil Turok of Cambridge University. Motivated by the section of\nparticle physics called string theory, Steinhardt envisions a universe with eleven dimensions, most of\nwhich are \u201ccompactified,\u201d more or less rolled up like a sock, so that they occupy only infinitesimal\namounts of space. But some of the additional dimensions have real size and significance, except that\nwe can\u2019t perceive them because we remain locked into our familiar four. If you pretend that all of\nspace in our universe fills an infinite thin sheet (this model reduces the three dimensions of space to\ntwo), you can imagine another, parallel sheet, and then picture the two sheets approaching and\ncolliding. The collision produces the big bang, and as the sheets rebound from one another, each\nsheet\u2019s history proceeds along familiar lines, giving birth to galaxies and stars. Eventually, the two\nsheets cease to separate and start to approach one another again, producing another collision and\nanother big bang in each sheet. The universe thus has a cyclical history, repeating itself, at least in its\nbroadest outlines, at intervals of hundreds of billions of years. Since \u201cekpyrosis\u201d means\n\u201cconflagration\u201d in Greek (recall the more familiar word \u201cpyromaniac\u201d), the \u201cekpyrotic universe\u201d\nreminds all those with Greek at the tips of their brains of the great fire that gave birth to the cosmos\nthat we know.\nThis ekpyrotic model of the universe has emotional and intellectual appeal, though not enough to\nwin the hearts and minds of many of Steinhardt\u2019s fellow cosmologists. Not yet, anyhow. Something\nvaguely like the ekpyrotic model, if not this model itself, may someday offer the breakthrough that\ncosmologists now await in their attempts to explain the dark energy. Even those who favor the\nanthropic approach would hardly dig in their heels to resist a new theory that could provide a good\nexplanation for the cosmological constant without invoking an infinite number of universes, of which\nours happens to be one of the lucky ones.

Indeed, the word \u201cgalaxy\u201d derives from the Greek \ngalaktos\n,\nor \u201cmilk.\u201d The sky also held the fuzzy objects, scientifically named nebulae after the Latin word for\nclouds\u2014objects of indeterminate shape such as the Crab nebula in the constellation Taurus, and the\nAndromeda nebula, which appears to live among the stars of the constellation Andromeda.\nHerschel\u2019s telescope had a mirror forty-eight inches across, an unprecedented size for 1789, the\nyear it was built. A complex array of trusses to support and point this telescope made it an ungainly\ninstrument, but when he aimed it at the heavens, Herschel could readily see the countless stars that\ncompose the Milky Way. Using his forty-eight-incher, as well as a smaller, more nimble telescope,\nHerschel and his sister Caroline compiled the first extensive \u201cdeep sky\u201d catalogue of northern\nnebulae. Sir John\u2014Herschel\u2019s son\u2014continued this family tradition, adding to his father\u2019s and aunt\u2019s\nlist of northern objects and, during an extended stay at the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of\nAfrica, cataloguing some 1,700 fuzzy objects visible from the Southern Hemisphere. In 1864, Sir John\nproduced a synthesis of the known deep sky objects: \nA General Catalogue of Nebulae and\n \nClusters\nof Stars,\n which included more than five thousand entries.\nIn spite of that large body of data, nobody at the time knew the true identity of the nebulae, their\ndistances from Earth, or the differences among them. Nevertheless, the 1864 catalogue made it\npossible to classify the nebulae morphologically\u2014that is, according to their shapes. In the \u201cwe call\n\u2019em as we see \u2019em\u201d tradition of baseball umpires (who came into their own just about the time that\nHerschel\u2019s \nGeneral Catalogue\n was published), astronomers named the spiral-shaped nebulae \u201cspiral\nnebulae,\u201d those with a vaguely elliptical shape \u201celliptical nebulae,\u201d and the various irregularly\nshaped nebulae\u2014neither spiral nor elliptical\u2014\u201cirregular nebulae.\u201d Finally, they called the nebulae\nthat looked small and round, like a telescopic image of a planet, \u201cplanetary nebulae,\u201d an act that has\npermanently confused newcomers to astronomy.\nFor most of its history, astronomy has remained plainspoken, using descriptive methods of inquiry\nthat greatly resembled those used in botany. Using their lengthening compendia of stars and fuzzy\nthings, astronomers searched for patterns and sorted objects according to them. Quite a sensible step,\ntoo. Most people, beginning in childhood, arrange things according to appearance and shape without\neven being told to do so. But this approach can carry you only so far. The Herschels always assumed,\nbecause many of their fuzzy objects span a patch of about the same size on the night sky, that all the\nnebulae lay at about the same distance from Earth.

Others turned out to be much more distant, so they must be much larger than the fuzzy objects\nrelatively close to us if they are to appear the same size on the sky.\nThe take-home lesson is that at some point you\u2019ve got to stop fixating on what something looks like\nand start asking what it is. Fortunately, by the late nineteenth century, advances in science and\ntechnology had empowered astronomers to do just that, to move beyond merely classifying the\ncontents of the universe. That shift led to the birth of astrophysics, the useful application of the laws\nof physics to astronomical situations.\nDuring the same\n era when Sir John Herschel published his vast catalogue of nebulae, a new scientific\ninstrument, the spectroscope, joined the search for nebulae. The sole job of a spectroscope is to break\nlight into a rainbow of its component colors. Those colors, and features embedded within them,\nreveal not only fine details about the chemical composition of the light source but also, because of a\nphenomenon called the Doppler effect, the motion of the light source toward or away from Earth.\nSpectroscopy revealed something remarkable: the spiral nebulae, which happen to predominate\noutside the swath of the Milky Way, are nearly all moving away from Earth, and at extremely high\nspeeds. In contrast, all the planetary nebulae, as well as most irregular nebulae, are traveling at\nrelatively low speeds\u2014some toward us and some away from us. Had some catastrophic explosion\ntaken place in the center of the Milky Way, booting out only the spiral nebulae? If so, why weren\u2019t any\nof them falling back? Were we catching the catastrophe at a special time? In spite of advances in\nphotography that brought forth faster emulsions, enabling astronomers to measure the spectra of ever\ndimmer nebulae, the exodus continued and these questions remained unanswered.\nMost advances in astronomy, as in other sciences, have been driven by the introduction of better\ntechnology. As the 1920s opened, another key instrument appeared on the scene: the formidable 100-\ninch Hooker Telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Pasadena, California. In 1923, the\nAmerican astronomer Edwin P. Hubble used this telescope\u2014the largest in the world at that time\u2014to\nfind a special breed of star, a Cepheid variable star, in the Andromeda nebula.

Because their brightness varies in recognizable cycles, patience and persistence will\nyield an increasing number to the careful observer. Hubble had found a few of these Cepheid\nvariables within the Milky Way and estimated their distances; yet, to his astonishment, the Cepheid he\nfound in Andromeda was much dimmer than any of those.\nThe most likely explanation for this dimness was that the new Cepheid variable, and the Andromeda\nnebula in which it lives, sits at a distance much greater than those to the Cepheids in the Milky Way.\nHubble realized that this placed the Andromeda nebula at so great a distance that it could not possibly\nlie among the stars in the constellation Andromeda, nor anywhere within the Milky Way\u2014and could\nnot have been kicked out, along with all its spiral sisters, during a catastrophe milk spill.\nThe implications were breathtaking.

The Andromeda nebula was, in fact, the Andromeda \ngalaxy\n.\nBy 1936, enough\n island universes had been identified and photographed through the Hooker and other\nlarge telescopes that Hubble, too, decided to try his hand at morphology. His analysis of galaxy types\nrested upon the untested assumption that variations from one shape to another among galaxies signify\nevolutionary steps from birth to death. In his 1936 book \nRealm of the Nebulae,\n Hubble classified\ngalaxies by placing the different types along a diagram shaped like a musical tuning fork, whose\nhandle represents the elliptical galaxies, with rounded ellipticals at the far end of the handle and\nflattened ellipticals near the point where the two tines join. Along one tine lie the ordinary spiral\ngalaxies: those nearest the handle have their spiral arms wound extremely tightly, while those toward\nthe tine\u2019s end have increasingly loosely wound spiral arms. Along the other tine are spiral galaxies\nwhose central region displays a straight \u201cbar,\u201d but are otherwise similar to ordinary spirals.\nHubble imagined that galaxies start their lives as round ellipticals and become flatter and flatter as\nthey continue to take shape, ultimately revealing a spiral structure that slowly unfurls with the passage\nof time. Brilliant. Beautiful. Even elegant. But just plain wrong. Not only were entire classes of\nirregular galaxies omitted from this scheme, but astrophysicists would later learn that the oldest stars\nin every galaxy were about the same age, implying that all the galaxies were born during a single era\nin the history of the universe.\nFor three decades (with some research opportunities lost because of World War II), astronomers\nobserved and catalogued galaxies in accordance with Hubble\u2019s tuning-fork diagram as ellipticals,\nspirals, and barred spirals, with irregulars a minority subset, completely off the chart because of their\nstrange shapes. Of elliptical galaxies one might say, as Ronald Reagan did about California\u2019s\nredwoods, that when you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. Elliptical galaxies resemble one another\nin possessing neither the spiral-arm patterns that characterize spirals and barred spirals, nor the giant\nclouds of interstellar gas and dust that give birth to new stars. In these galaxies, star formation ended\nmany billion years ago, leaving behind spherical or ellipsoidal groups of stars. The largest elliptical\ngalaxies, like the largest spirals, each contain many hundred billion stars\u2014perhaps even a trillion or\nmore\u2014and have diameters close to a hundred thousand light-years. With the exception of\nprofessional astronomers, no one has ever sighed over the fantastic patterns and complex star\nformation histories of an elliptical galaxy for the excellent reason that, at least in comparison with\nspirals, ellipticals have simple shapes and straightforward star formation: they all turned gas and dust\ninto stars until they could do so no more.\nHappily, spirals and barred spirals furnish the visual excitement so lacking in ellipticals. The most\ndeeply resonant of all the galaxy images that we may ever see, a view of the entire Milky Way taken\nfrom outside it, will stir our hearts and minds, just as soon as we manage to send a camera several\nhundred thousand light-years above or below the central plane of our galaxy.

For the time being, astronomers\nmust continue to map the Milky Way from inside, sketching the galactic forest by delineating its stellar\nand nebular trees. These efforts reveal that our galaxy closely resembles our closest large neighbor,\nthe great spiral galaxy in Andromeda. Conveniently located about 2.4 million light-years away, the\nAndromeda galaxy has provided a wealth of information about the basic structural patterns of spiral\ngalaxies, as well as about different types of stars and their evolution. Because all of the Andromeda\ngalaxy\u2019s stars have the same distance from us (plus or minus a few percent), astronomers know that\nthe stars\u2019 brightnesses correlate directly with their luminosities, that is, with the amounts of energy\nthey emit each second. This fact, denied to astronomers when they study objects in the Milky Way but\napplicable to every galaxy beyond our own, has allowed them to draw key conclusions about stellar\nevolution with greater ease than would be true for stars in the Milky Way. Two elliptical satellite\ngalaxies that orbit the Andromeda galaxy, each containing a few percent of the number of stars in the\nmain galaxy, have likewise furnished important information about the lives of stars, and the overall\ngalactic structure of elliptical galaxies. On a clear night far from city lights, a keen-eyed observer\nwho knows where to look can spot the fuzzy outline of the Andromeda galaxy\u2014the most distant\nobject visible to the unaided eye, shining with light that left on its journey while our ancestors roamed\nthe gorges of Africa in search of roots and berries.\nLike the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy lies midway along one tine of Hubble\u2019s tuning-fork\ndiagram, because its spiral arms are neither particularly tightly nor loosely wound. If galaxies were\nanimals in a zoo, there would be one cage devoted to ellipticals but several animal houses for the\nglorious spirals. To study a Hubble Telescope image of one of these beasts, typically (for the closer\nones) seen from 10 or 20 million light-years, is to enter a world of sight so rich in possibility, so\ndeep in separation from life on Earth, so complex in structure, that the unprepared mind may reel, or\nmay provide a defense by reminding its owner that none of this can thin the thighs or heal the fractured\nbone.\nIrregulars, the orphans of the galactic class system, comprise about 10 percent of all galaxies, with\nthe rest split between spirals and ellipticals, strongly favoring spirals. In contrast to ellipticals,\nirregular galaxies typically contain a higher proportion of gas and dust than spirals do, and offer the\nliveliest sites of ongoing star formation. The Milky Way has two large satellite galaxies, both\nirregular, confusingly named the Magellanic Clouds because the first white men to notice them,\nsailors on Magellan\u2019s circumnavigation of Earth in 1520, thought at first they were seeing wisps of\nclouds in the sky. This honor fell to Magellan\u2019s expedition because the Magellanic Clouds lie so\nclose to the south celestial pole (the point directly above Earth\u2019s South Pole) that they never rise\nabove the horizon for observers in the most populated Northern latitudes, including those in Europe\nand most of the United States. Each of the Magellanic Clouds contains many billion stars, though not\nthe hundreds of billions that characterize the Milky Way and other large galaxies, and display\nimmense star-forming regions, most notably the \u201cTarantula nebula\u201d of the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nThis galaxy also has the honor of having revealed the closest and brightest supernova to appear\nduring the past three centuries, Supernova 1987A, which must have actually exploded about 160,000\nB.C.\n for its light to reach Earth in 1987.\nUntil the 1960s, astronomers were content to classify almost all galaxies as spiral, barred spiral,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3908, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76d80e93-ceea-4720-85ac-e433e199777f": {"__data__": {"id_": "76d80e93-ceea-4720-85ac-e433e199777f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6d4dcd0-10c2-4c19-b79b-43ebd66c2eb0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "43111605800c25d27e2c94dff34b916b5eea92d42e1ff041b456f15213942c89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ellipitical, or irregular.

(With one galactic class called \u201cirregular,\u201d this result might seem to be a slam dunk.)\nBut during that fine decade, an American astronomer named Halton Arp became the champion of\ngalaxies that did not fit the simple classification scheme of the Hubble tuning-fork diagram plus\nirregulars. In the spirit of \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,\u201d Arp used the\nworld\u2019s largest telescope, the 200-inch Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego,\nCalifornia, to photograph 338 extremely disturbed-looking systems. Arp\u2019s \nAtlas of Peculiar\nGalaxies,\n published in 1966, became a veritable treasure chest of research opportunities on what can\ngo bad in the universe. Although \u201cpeculiar galaxies\u201d\u2014defined as galaxies with such strange shapes\nthat even \u201cirregular\u201d fails to do them justice\u2014form only a tiny minority of all galaxies, they carry\nimportant information about what can happen to galaxies gone wrong. It turns out, for example, that\nmany embarrassingly peculiar galaxies in Arp\u2019s atlas are the merged remnants of two once-separate\ngalaxies that have collided. This means that those \u201cpeculiar\u201d galaxies are not different kinds of\ngalaxies at all, any more than a wrecked Lexus is a new kind of car.\nTo track how\n such a collision unfolds, you need a lot more than pencil and paper, because every star in\nboth galactic systems has its own gravity, which simultaneously affects all the other stars in the two\nsystems. What you need, in short, is a computer. Galaxy collisions are stately dramas, taking hundreds\nof millions of years from beginning to end. Using a computer simulation, you can start, and pause as\nyou like, a collision of two galaxies, taking snapshots after 10 million years, 50 million years, 100\nmillion years. At each time things look different. And when you step into Arp\u2019s atlas\u2014batta-bing\u2014\nhere\u2019s an early stage of a collision, and there\u2019s a late stage. Here\u2019s a glancing blow, and there\u2019s a\nhead-on collision.\nAlthough the first computer simulations were done in the early 1960s (and although the Swedish\nastronomer Erik Holmberg made a clever attempt during the 1940s to recreate a galaxy collision on a\ntabletop by using light as an analogue to gravity), it wasn\u2019t until 1972 that Alar and Juri Toomre,\nbrothers who both teach at MIT, generated the first compelling portrait of a \u201cdeliberately simple-\nminded\u201d collision between two spiral galaxies. The Toomres\u2019 model revealed that tidal forces\u2014\ndifferences in gravity from place to place\u2014actually rip the galaxies apart. As one galaxy nears the\nother, the gravitational force rapidly grows stronger at the leading edges of the collision, stretching\nand warping both galaxies as they pass by or through each other. That stretching and warping accounts\nfor most of what\u2019s peculiar in Arp\u2019s atlas of peculiar galaxies.\nHow else can computer simulations help us to understand galaxies? Hubble\u2019s tuning fork\ndistinguishes \u201cnormal\u201d spiral galaxies from spirals that show a dense bar of stars across their centers.\nSimulations show that this bar could be a transitory feature, not the distinguishing mark of a different\ngalactic species. Contemporary observers of barred spirals might simply be catching such galaxies\nduring a phase that will disappear in 100 million years or so. But since we can\u2019t hang around long\nenough to watch the bar disappear in real life, we have to watch it come and go on a computer, where\na billion years can unfold in a matter of minutes.\nArp\u2019s peculiar galaxies\n proved to be the tip of an iceberg, a strange world of not-exactly-galaxies whose", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3700, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "708782b0-b61b-454d-82df-03b562af6524": {"__data__": {"id_": "708782b0-b61b-454d-82df-03b562af6524", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54f46ef1-4d60-463e-ab20-335de8f8fdd8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "e439954887e609778da1669174ccae764d2cd52494ac253fe282ee50040d065b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "outlines astronomers began to discern during the 1960s and came to understand a few decades later.\nBefore we can appreciate this emergent galactic zoo, we must resume the story of cosmic evolution\nwhere we left it.

Throughout the\ncosmos, matter has consistently organized itself into structures. From its nearly perfectly smooth\ndistribution soon after the big bang, matter has clumped itself together on all size scales, to produce\ngiant clusters and superclusters of galaxies, as well as the individual galaxies within those clusters,\nthe stars that congregate by the billions in every galaxy, and quite possibly much smaller objects\u2014\nplanets, their satellites, asteroids, and comets\u2014that orbit many if not most of those stars.\nTo understand the origin of the objects that now compose the visible universe, we must focus on the\nmechanisms that turned the universe\u2019s formerly diffuse matter into highly structured components. A\ncomplete description of how structures emerged in the cosmos requires that we meld two aspects of\nreality whose combination now eludes us. As seen in earlier chapters, we must perceive how\nquantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of molecules, atoms, and the particles that form\nthem, fits with general relativity theory, which describes how extremely large amounts of matter and\nspace affect one another.\nAttempts to create a single theory that would unite our knowledge of the sub-atomically small and\nthe astronomically large began with Albert Einstein. They have continued, with relatively little\nsuccess, right up to the present time and will endure into an uncertain future, until they achieve \u201cgrand\nunification.\u201d Among all the unknowns that irk them, modern cosmologists feel most acutely the lack of\na theory that triumphantly blends quantum mechanics with general relativity. Meanwhile, these\nseemingly immiscible branches of physics\u2014the science of the small and the science of the large\u2014\ncare not a whit for our ignorance; instead, they co-exist with remarkable success inside the same\nuniverse, mocking our attempts to understand them as a coherent whole. A galaxy with 100 billion\nstars apparently pays no particular attention to the physics of the atoms and molecules that compose\nits star systems and gas clouds. Neither do the even larger agglomerations of matter we call galaxy\nclusters and superclusters, themselves containing hundreds, sometimes thousands of galaxies. But\nthese largest structures in the universe nonetheless owe their very existence to immeasurably small\nquantum fluctuations within the primeval cosmos. To understand how these structures arose, we must\ndo the best we can in our current state of ignorance, passing from the minuscule domains governed by\nquantum mechanics, which hold the key to the origin of structure, to those so large that quantum\nmechanics plays no role, and matter obeys the laws laid down by general relativity.\nTo this end, we must seek to explain the structure-laden universe that we see today as arising from a\nnearly featureless cosmos soon after the big bang.

In a homogenous\nuniverse, every location looks similar to every other location, like the contents of a glass of\nhomogenized milk. An isotropic universe is one that looks the same in every direction from any given\npoint in space and time. These two descriptions may seem the same, but they are not. For example, the\nlines of longitude on Earth are not homogeneous, because they are farther apart in some regions and\ncloser together in others; they are isotropic in just two places, the North and South poles, where all\nlines of longitude converge. If you stand at either the \u201ctop\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d of the world, the longitude\ngrid will look the same to you, no matter how far to the left or the right you turn your head. In a more\nphysical example, imagine yourself atop a perfect, cone-shaped mountain, and imagine that this\nmountain is the only thing in the world. Then every view of Earth\u2019s surface from that perch would\nlook the same. The same would be true if you happened to live in the center of an archery target, or if\nyou were a spider at the center of its perfectly spun web. In each of these cases, your view will be\nisotropic, but decidedly not homogenous.\nAn example of a homogeneous but non-isotropic pattern appears in a wall of identical rectangular\nbricks, laid in a bricklayer\u2019s traditional, overlapping manner. On the scale of several adjoining bricks\nand their mortar, the wall will be the same everywhere\u2014bricks\u2014but different lines of sight along the\nwall will intersect the mortar differently, destroying any claim to isotropy.\nIntriguingly (for those who love a certain kind of intrigue), mathematical analysis tells us that space\nwill turn out to be homogeneous only if it is everywhere isotropic. Another formal theorem of\nmathematics tells us that if space is isotropic in just three places, then space must be isotropic\neverywhere. Yet some of us shun mathematics as uninteresting and unproductive!\nAlthough cosmologists were aesthetically motivated for assuming the homogeneity and isotropy of\nthe distribution of matter in space, they have come to believe in this assumption enough to establish it\nas a fundamental cosmological principle. We might also call this the principle of mediocrity: Why\nshould one part of the universe be any more interesting than another? On the smallest scales of size\nand distance, we easily recognize this assertion to be false. We live on a solid planet with an average\ndensity of matter close to 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter (in Americanese, that\u2019s about 340 pounds\nper cubic foot). Our Sun, a typical star, has an average density of about 1.4 grams per cubic\ncentimeter. The interplanetary spaces between the two, however, have a significantly smaller average\ndensity\u2014smaller by a factor of about 1 billion trillion. Intergalactic space, which accounts for most\nof the volume of the universe, contains less than one atom in every ten cubic meters. Here the average\ndensity falls below the density of interplanetary space by another factor of 1 billion\u2014enough to make\nthe mind feel good about the occasional accusation of being dense.\nAs astrophysicists expanded their horizons, they saw clearly that a galaxy such as our Milky Way\nconsists of stars that float through nearly empty interstellar space. The galaxies likewise group into\nclusters that violate the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy. The hope remained, however, that as\nastrophysicists charted visible matter on the largest scales, they would find that galaxy clusters have a\nhomogenous and isotropic distribution.

Turns out, the contents of a 300-million-light-year scoop of the universe does indeed\nresemble other scoops of the same size, fulfilling the long-sought aesthetic criterion for the cosmos.\nBut, of course, on smaller scales, everything has clumped itself into distinctly non-homogeneous and\nnon-isotropic distributions of matter.\nThree centuries ago, Isaac Newton considered the question of how matter acquired structure. His\ncreative mind easily embraced the concept of an isotropic and homogeneous universe, but promptly\nraised an issue that would not occur to most of us: How can you make any structure at all in the\nuniverse without having all the matter of the universe joining it to create one gigantic mass? Newton\nargued that since we observe no such mass the universe must be infinite. In 1692, writing to Richard\nBentley, the master of Trinity College at Cambridge University, Newton proposed that\nif all the matter in the universe were evenly scattered throughout all the heavens, and every\nparticle had an innate gravity toward all the rest, and the whole space throughout which this matter\nwas scattered was but finite, the matter on the outside of the space would, by its gravity, tend\ntoward all the matter on the inside, and by consequence, fall down into the middle of the whole\nspace and there compose one great spherical mass. But if the matter was evenly disposed\nthroughout an infinite space, it could never convene into one mass; but some of it would convene\ninto one mass and some into another, so as to make an infinite number of great masses, scattered at\ngreat distances from one to another throughout all that infinite space.\nNewton presumed that his infinite universe must be static, neither expanding nor contracting. Within\nthis universe, objects were \u201cconvened\u201d by gravitational forces\u2014the attraction that every object with\nmass exerts on all other objects. His conclusion about gravity\u2019s central role in creating structure\nremains valid today, even though cosmologists face a task more daunting than Newton\u2019s. Far from\nenjoying the benefits of a static universe, we must allow for the fact that the universe has been\nexpanding ever since the big bang, naturally opposing any tendency for matter to clump together by\ngravity.

At first glance, we could no more rely on gravity to form massive\nobjects out of diffuse gas than we could use a shovel to move fleas across a barnyard. Yet somehow\ngravity has done the trick.\nDuring the early days of the universe, the cosmos expanded so rapidly that if the universe had been\nstrictly homogenous and isotropic on all size scales, gravity would have had no chance of victory.\nToday these would be no galaxies, stars, planets, or people, only a scattered distribution of atoms\neverywhere in space\u2014a dull and boring cosmos, devoid of admirers and objects of admiration. But\nours is a fun and exciting universe only because \nin\nhomogeneities and \nan\nisotropies appeared during\nthose earliest cosmic moments, which served as a kind of cosmic soup-starter for all concentrations\nof matter and energy that would later emerge. Without this head start, the rapidly expanding universe\nwould have prevented gravity from ever gathering matter to build the familiar structures we take for\ngranted in the universe today.\nWhat made these deviations, the inhomogeneities and aniso-tropies that provide the seeds for all the\nstructure in the cosmos? The answer arrives from the realm of quantum mechanics, undreamt of by\nIsaac Newton but unavoidable if we hope to understand where we came from. Quantum mechanics\ntells us that on the smallest scales of size, no distribution of matter can remain homogeneous and\nisotropic. Instead, random fluctuations in the distribution of matter will appear, disappear, and\nreappear in different amount, as matter becomes a quivering mass of vanishing and reborn particles.\nAt any particular time, some regions of space will have slightly more particles, and therefore a\nslightly greater density, than other regions. From this counterintuitive, airy-fairy fantasy, we derive\neverything that exists. The slightly denser regions had the chance to attract slightly more particles by\ngravity, and with time the cosmos grew these denser regions into structures.\nIn tracing the growth of structure from times soon after the big bang, we can gain some insight from\ntwo key epochs we have already met, the \u201cera of inflation,\u201d when the universe expanded at an\nastounding rate, and the \u201ctime of decoupling,\u201d about 380,000 years after the big bang, when the\ncosmic background radiation ceased to interact with matter.\nThe inflationary era lasted from about 10\n-37\n second to 10\n-33\n second after the big bang. During that\nrelatively brief stretch of time, the fabric of space and time expanded faster than light, growing in a\nbillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second from one hundred billion billion times smaller than\nthe size of a proton to about 4 inches. Yes, the observable universe once fit within a grapefruit. But\nwhat caused the cosmic inflation? Cosmologists have named the culprit: a \u201cphase transition\u201d that left\nbehind a specific and observable signature in the cosmic background radiation.\nPhase transitions are hardly unique to cosmology; they often occur in the privacy of your home. We\nfreeze water to make ice cubes, and boil water to produce steam. Sugary water grows sugar crystals\non a string dangling within the liquid. And wet, gooey batter turns into cake when baked. There\u2019s a\npattern here. In every case, things look very different on the two sides of a phase transition. The\ninflationary model of the universe asserts that when the universe was young, the prevailing energy\nfield went through a phase transition, one of several that would have occurred during these early\ntimes. This particular episode not only catapulted the early, rapid expansion but also imbued the\ncosmos with a specific fluctuating pattern of high- and low-density regions.

We can hope to find evidence for these variations\nfrom place to place in the cosmic background radiation, which serves as a proscenium that separates\nthe current epoch from, and also connects it with, the first moments of the neonate universe.\nAs we have already seen, the cosmic background radiation consists of the photons generated during\nthe first minutes after the big bang. Early in the universe\u2019s history, these photons interacted with\nmatter, slamming into any atoms that happened to form so energetically that no atoms could exist for\nlong. But the ongoing expansion of the universe in effect robbed the photons of energy, so that\neventually, at the time of decoupling, none of the photons had energies sufficient to prevent electrons\nfrom orbiting around protons and helium nuclei. Since that time, 380,000 years after the big bang,\natoms have persisted\u2014unless some local disturbance, such as the radiation from a nearby star,\ndisrupts them\u2014while the photons, each with an ever-diminishing amount of energy, continue to roam\nthe universe, collectively forming the cosmic background radiation or CBR.\nThe CBR thus carries the imprint of history, a snapshot of what the universe was like at the time of\ndecoupling. Astrophysicists have learned how to examine this snapshot with ever-increasing\naccuracy. First, the simple fact that the CBR exists, that their basic understanding of the history of the\nuniverse is correct. And then, after years of improving their abilities to measure the cosmic\nbackground radiation, their sophisticated balloon-borne and satellite instruments gave them a map of\nthe CBR\u2019s tiny deviations from homogeneity. This map provides the record of the once minuscule\nfluctuations whose size increased as the universe expanded during the few hundred thousand years\nafter the era of inflation, and which then grew, during the next billion years or so, into the large-scale\ndistribution of matter in the cosmos.\nRemarkable though it may seem, the CBR provides us with the means for mapping the imprint of the\nlong-vanished early universe, and for locating\u201414 billion light-years away in all directions\u2014the\nregions of slightly greater density that would become galaxy clusters and superclusters. Regions with\ngreater-than-average density left behind slightly more photons than regions with lower densities. As\nthe cosmos became transparent, thanks to the loss of energy that left the photons unable to interact\nwith the newly formed atoms, each photon embarked on a journey that would carry it far from its\npoint of origin.

Without the seeds of matter they betray, we would have no explanation for\nwhy we exist. As happy fate would have it, the anisotropies appeared precisely on schedule.

The teeny fluctuations from\nplace to place in the amounts of microwave photons that form the CBR, now delineated with\nimpressive precision by WMAP, embody the record of cosmic fluctuations at a time 380,000 years\nafter the big bang.

These regions today have grown to contain about 1,000 galaxies, each\nwith 100 billion stars. If we add the dark matter in such a supercluster, its total mass reaches the\nequivalent of 10\n16\n Suns. Conversely, the larger cool spots, with no head start against the expanding\nuniverse, evolved to become nearly devoid of massive structures.

But when the first stars formed, in the absence of atoms and molecules that would absorb\nstarlight, infalling gas consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, providing only token\nresistance to stars\u2019 output.

But the seeds of life\nbegan with the long-vanished first generation of high-mass stars.\nDuring the first\n few billion years after the time of decoupling, gravitationally induced collapse\nproceeded with abandon, as gravity drew matter together on nearly all scales. One of the natural\nresults of gravity at work was the formation of supermassive black holes, each with a mass millions\nor billions of times the mass of the Sun. Black holes with that amount of mass are about the size of\nNeptune\u2019s orbit and wreak havoc on their nascent environment. Gas clouds drawn toward these black\nholes want to gain speed, but they can\u2019t, because there\u2019s too much stuff in the way. Instead, they slam\ninto and rub against whatever came in just before them, descending toward their master in a swirling\nmaelstrom. Just before these clouds disappear forever, collisions within their superheated matter\nradiate titanic quantities of energy, billions of times the Sun\u2019s luminosity, all within the volume of a\nsolar system. Monstrous jets of matter and radiation spew forth, extending hundreds of thousands of\nlight-years above and below the swirling gas, as the energy punches through and escapes the funnel in\nall ways it can. As one cloud falls, and another orbits-in-waiting, the luminosity of the system\nfluctuates, getting brighter and dimmer over a matter of hours, days, or weeks. If the jets happen to be\naimed straight at you, the system will look even more luminous, and more variable in its output, than\nthose cases in which the jets point to the side. Viewed from any appreciable distance, all of these\nblack hole\u2013plus\u2013infalling-matter combinations will appear amazingly small and luminous in\ncomparison to the galaxies we see today. What the universe has created\u2014the objects whose birth we\nhave just witnessed in words\u2014are quasars.\nQuasars were discovered during the early 1960s, as astronomers began to use telescopes equipped\nwith detectors sensitive to invisible domains of radiation, such as radio waves and X-rays. Their\ngalaxy portraits could therefore include information about the galaxies\u2019 appearance in those other\nbands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Combine this with further improvements in photographic\nemulsions, and a new zoo of galaxy species emerged from the depths of space. Most remarkable\namong them were objects that, in photographs, look like simple stars, but\u2014quite unlike stars\u2014\nproduce extraordinary amounts of radio waves. The working description for those objects was\n\u201cquasistellar radio source\u201d\u2014a term quickly shortened to quasar. Even more remarkable than the\nradio emission from these objects were their distances: as a class, they turned out to be the most\ndistant objects known in the universe. For quasars to be that small and still visible at immense\ndistances meant that they had to be an entirely new kind of object. How small? No bigger than a solar\nsystem. How luminous?

As detection tactics and technologies improved\nfurther, every quasar revealed fuzz; some even revealed a spiral structure. Quasars, it turned out, are\nnot a new kind of object but rather a new kind of galactic nucleus.\nIn April 1991,\n the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched one of the most\nexpensive astronomical instruments ever built: the Hubble Space Telescope.

But not all galaxies\nwere quasars in their youth.\nThe growing roster \nof ordinary galaxies known to have a black hole at their center began to raise\neyebrows among investigators: A supermassive black hole that was not a quasar? A quasar that\u2019s\nsurrounded by a galaxy? One can\u2019t help but think of a new picture of how things work. In this picture,\nsome galaxies begin their lives as quasars. To be a quasar, which is really just the blazing visible\ncore of an otherwise run-of-the-mill galaxy, the system has to have not only a massive, hungry black\nhole but also an ample supply of infalling gas. Once the supermassive black hole has gulped down all\nthe available food, leaving uneaten stars and gas in distant, safe orbits, the quasar simply shuts off.\nYou\u2019ve then got a docile galaxy with a dormant black hole snoozing at its center.\nAstronomers have found other new types of objects, classified as intermediate between quasars and\nnormal galaxies, whose properties also depend on the bad behavior of supermassive black holes.\nSometimes the streams of material falling into a galaxy\u2019s central black hole flow slowly and steadily.\nAt other times episodically. Such systems populate the menagerie of galaxies whose nuclei are active\nbut not ferocious. Over the years, names for the various types accumulated: LINERs (low-ionization\nnuclear emission-line regions), Seyfert galaxies, N galaxies, blazars.

During the mid- to late 1990s, investigators improved their black hole\nmodel, and found that they could characterize nearly all the beasts in the AGN zoo by measuring only\na few parameters: the mass of the object\u2019s black hole, the rate at which it\u2019s being fed, and our angle of\nview on the accretion disk and its jets.

But when\nwe calculate how much energy they wield\u2014that is, when we compute the energy that they released as\npart of their formation\u2014we find that black holes dominate the energetics of galaxy formation. All the\nenergy of all the orbits of all the stars and gas clouds that ultimately compose a galaxy pales when\ncompared with what made the black hole. Without supermassive black holes lurking below, galaxies\nas we know them might have never formed. The once luminous but now invisible black hole that lies\nat the center of each giant galaxy provides a hidden link, the physical explanation for the\nagglomeration of matter into a complex system of billions of stars in orbit around a common center.\nThe broader explanation for the formation of galaxies invokes not only the gravity produced by\nsupermassive black holes but also gravity in more conventional astronomical settings. What made the\nbillions of stars in a galaxy? Gravity did this too, producing up to hundreds of thousands of stars in a\nsingle cloud.

In elliptical galaxies, no such plane exists, and all of their\ngas has already turned into stars. Spiral galaxies, however, have highly flattened distributions of\nmatter, characterized by a central plane within which the youngest, brightest stars form in spiral\npatterns, testimony to great vibrating waves of alternating dense and rarefied gas that orbit the\ngalactic center. Like hot marshmallows that stick together upon contact, all of the gas in a spiral\ngalaxy that did not swiftly participate in making star clusters has fallen toward the galactic plane,\nstuck to itself, and created a disk of matter that slowly manufactures stars. For past billions of years,\nand for billions of years to come, stars will continue to form in spiral galaxies, with each generation\nmore enriched in heavy elements than the next. These heavy elements (by which astrophysicists mean\nall elements heavier than helium) have been cast forth into interstellar space by outflows from aging\nstars or as the explosive remains of high-mass stars, a species of supernova. Their existence renders\nthe galaxy\u2014and thus the universe\u2014ever more friendly to the chemistry of life as we know it.\nWe have outlined \nthe birth of a classical spiral galaxy, in an evolutionary sequence that has played out\ntens of billions of times, yielding galaxies in a host of different arrangements: In clusters of galaxies.\nIn long strings and filaments of galaxies. And in sheets of galaxies.\nBecause we look back in time as we look outward into space, we possess the ability to examine\ngalaxies not only as they are now but also as they appeared billions of years ago, simply by looking\nup. The problem with turning this concept into observational reality resides in the fact that galaxies\nbillions of light-years away appear to us as extremely small and dim objects, so even our best\ntelescopes can barely resolve their outlines. Nevertheless, astrophysicists have made great progress\nin this effort during the past few years. The breakthrough came in 1995, when Robert Williams, then\nthe director of the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University, arranged for the\nHubble Telescope to point toward a single direction in space, near the Big Dipper, for ten days\u2019\nworth of observation. Williams deserves the credit because the telescope\u2019s Time Allocation\nCommittee, which selects the observing proposals most worthy of actual telescope time, judged it\nunworthy of support. After all, the region to be studied was deliberately chosen for having nothing\ninteresting to look at, and thus to represent a dull and boring patch of sky. As a result, no ongoing\nprojects could benefit directly from such a large commitment of the telescope\u2019s highly oversubscribed\nobserving time. Happily, Williams, as the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, had the\nright to assign a few percent of the total\u2014his \u201cdirector\u2019s discretionary time\u201d\u2014and invested his clout\non what became known as the Hubble Deep Field, one of the most famous astronomical photographs\never taken.\nThe ten-day exposure, coincidentally made during the government shutdown of 1995, produced by\nfar the most researched image in the history of astronomy.

Comparison of the two images allowed astronomers to assure themselves that the results\nfrom the first deep field did not represent an anomaly (for example, if the two images had been\nidentical in every detail, or statistically unlike each other in every way, one might have concluded that\nthe devil was at work), and to refine their conclusions about how different types of galaxies form.\nAfter a successful servicing mission, in which the Hubble Telescope was outfitted with even better\n(more sensitive) detectors, the Space Telescope Science Institute just couldn\u2019t resist and, in 2004,\nauthorized the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, laying bare the ever more distant cosmos.\nUnfortunately, the earliest stages of galaxy formation, which would be revealed to us by objects at\nthe greatest distances, confound even the Hubble Telescope\u2019s best efforts, not least because the\ncosmic expansion has shifted most of their radiation into the infrared region of the spectrum, not\naccessible to the telescope\u2019s instruments.

Long known as the\n(lower-case) \u201cmilky way\u201d in the sky, this milk-white haze combines the light from a staggering\nnumber of stars and gaseous nebulae. Those who observe the milky way with binoculars or a\nbackyard telescope will see the dark and boring areas resolve themselves into, well, dark and boring\nareas\u2014but the bright areas will turn from a diffuse glow into countless stars and nebulae.\nIn his small book \nSidereus Nuncius\n \n(The Starry Messenger)\n, published in Venice in 1610, Galileo\nGalilei provided the first account of the heavens as seen through a telescope, including a description\nof the milky way\u2019s patches of light. Referring to his instrument as a spyglass, since the name telescope\n(\u201cfar-seer\u201d in Greek) had yet to be coined, Galileo could barely contain himself:\nThe milky way itself, which, with the aid of the spyglass, may be observed so well that all the\ndisputes that for so many generations have vexed philosophers are destroyed by visible certainty,\nand we are liberated from wordy arguments. For the Galaxy is nothing else than a congeries of\ninnumerable stars distributed in clusters. To whatever region of it you direct your spyglass, an\nimmense number of stars immediately offer themselves to view, of which very many appear rather\nlarge and very conspicuous but the multitude of small ones is truly unfathomable.\n*\nSurely Galileo\u2019s \u201cimmense number of stars,\u201d which delineate the most densely packed regions of our\nMilky Way galaxy, must locate the real astronomical action. Why, then, should anybody be interested\nin the intervening dark areas with no visible stars? Based on their visual appearance, the dark areas\nare probably cosmic holes, openings to the infinite and empty spaces beyond.\nThree centuries would pass before anyone figured out that the dark patches in the milky way, far\nfrom being holes, actually consist of dense clouds of gas and dust that obscure more distant star fields\nand hold stellar nurseries deep within themselves. Following earlier suggestions by the American\nastronomer George Cary Comstock, who wondered why faraway stars are much dimmer than their\ndistances alone would indicate, the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn in 1909 identified\nthe culprit.

As\nfar as we know, cosmic dust contains nobody\u2019s epidermis. However, interstellar dust does include a\nremarkable ensemble of complex molecules, which emit photons primarily in the infrared and\nmicrowave regions of the spectrum. Astrophysicists lacked good microwave telescopes until the\n1960s, and effective infrared telescopes until the 1970s. Once they had created these observational\ninstruments, they could investigate the true chemical richness of the stuff that lies between the stars.\nDuring the decades that followed these technological advances, a fascinating, intricate picture of star\nbirth emerged.\nNot all gas clouds will form stars at all times. More often than not, a cloud finds itself confused\nabout what to do next. Actually, astrophysicists are the confused ones here. We know that an\ninterstellar cloud \u201cwants\u201d to collapse under its own gravity to make one or more stars. But the\ncloud\u2019s rotation, as well as the effects of turbulent gas motions within the cloud, oppose that result.\nSo, too, does the gas pressure that you learned about in high school chemistry class. Magnetic fields\ncan also fight collapse. They penetrate the cloud and constrain the motions of any free-roaming\ncharged particles contained therein, resisting compression and thus impeding the ways in which the\ncloud can respond to its own gravity. The scary part of this thought-exercise comes from the\nrealization that if no one knew in advance that stars exist, front-line research would offer plenty of\nconvincing reasons why stars could never form.\nLike the several hundred billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy, named after the band of light that the\ngalaxy\u2019s most densely populated regions paint across our skies, giant clouds of gas orbit our galaxy\u2019s\ncenter. The stars amount to tiny specks, only a few light-seconds across, that float in a vast ocean of\nnearly empty space, occasionally passing close by one another like ships in the night. Gas clouds, on\nthe other hand, are huge. Typically spanning hundreds of light-years, they each contain as much mass\nas a million Suns. As these giant clouds lumber through the galaxy, they often collide with one\nanother, entangling their gas- and dust-laden innards. Sometimes, depending on their relative speeds\nand their angles of impact, the clouds stick together; at other times, adding injury to the insult of\ncollision, they rip each other apart.\nIf a cloud cools to a sufficiently low temperature (less than about 100 degrees above absolute zero),\nits constituent atoms will stick together when they collide, rather than careening off one another as\nthey do at higher temperatures. This chemical transition has consequences for everybody. The\ngrowing particles\u2014now containing tens of atoms each\u2014begin to scatter visible light to and fro,\nstrongly attenuating the light of the stars behind the cloud. By the time that the particles become full-\ngrown dust grains, they each contain billions of atoms. Aging stars manufacture similar dust grains\nand blow them gently into interstellar space during their \u201cred-giant\u201d phases.

As this occurs, the pressure from the photons, transmitted to the molecules that\nabsorb it, pushes the cloud in the direction opposite to the direction of the light source. The cloud has\nnow coupled itself to starlight.\nStar birth occurs when the forces that make a cloud progressively denser eventually lead to its\ngravitationally induced collapse, during which each part of the cloud pulls all the other parts much\ncloser. Since hot gas resists compression and collapse more effectively than cool gas does, we face\nan odd situation. We must cool the cloud before it can ever heat itself by producing a star. In other\nwords, the creation of a star that possesses a 10-million-degree core, sufficiently hot for\nthermonuclear fusion to begin, requires that the cloud must first achieve its coldest possible internal\nconditions. Only at extremely cold temperatures, a few dozen degrees above absolute zero, can the\ncloud collapse and allow star formation to begin in earnest.\nWhat happens within a cloud to turn its collapse into newborn stars? Astrophysicists can only\ngesticulate. Much as they would like to track the internal dynamics of a large, massive interstellar\ncloud, the creation of a computer model that includes the laws of physics, all the internal and external\ninfluences on the cloud, and all the relevant chemical reactions that can occur within it still lies\nbeyond our abilities. A further challenge resides in the humbling fact that the original cloud has a size\nbillions of times larger than that of the star we are trying to create\u2014which in turn has a density 100\nsextillion times the average density within in the cloud. In these situations, what matters most on one\nscale of sizes may not be the right thing to worry about on another.\nNevertheless, relying on what we see throughout the cosmos, we can safely assert that within the\ndeepest, darkest, densest regions of an interstellar cloud, where temperatures fall to about 10 degrees\nabove absolute zero, gravity does cause pockets of gas to collapse, easily overcoming the resistance\noffered by magnetic fields and other impediments. The contraction converts the cloud pockets\u2019\ngravitational energy into heat. The temperature within each of these regions\u2014soon to become the core\nof a newborn star\u2014rises rapidly during the collapse, breaking apart all the dust grains in the\nimmediate vicinity as they collide. Eventually, the temperature in the central region of the collapsing\ngas pocket reaches the crucial value of 10 million degrees on the absolute scale.\nAt this magic temperature, some of the protons (which are simply naked hydrogen atoms, shorn of\nthe electron that orbits them) move fast enough to overcome their mutual repulsion. Their high speeds\nallow the protons to approach one another closely enough for the \u201cstrong nuclear force\u201d to make them\nbond. This force, which operates only at extremely short distances, binds together the protons and\nneutrons in all nuclei. The thermonuclear fusion of protons\u2014\u201cthermo\u201d because it occurs at high\ntemperatures, and \u201cnuclear fusion\u201d because it fuses particles into a single nucleus\u2014creates helium\nnuclei, each of which has a mass slightly less than the sum of the particles from which it fused.

For reasons not well understood, a typical giant gas cloud can develop a\nmultitude of cold pockets that all tend to collapse at about the same time to give birth to stars\u2014some\npuny and others giants. But the odds favor the puny: for every high-mass star, a thousand low-mass\nstars are born. The fact that no more than a few percent of all the gas in the original cloud participates\nin star birth presents a classic challenge in explaining star formation: What makes the star-forming\ntail wag the largely unchanged dog of an interstellar gas cloud? The answer probably lies in the\nradiation produced by newborn stars, which tends to inhibit further star formation.\nWe can easily explain the lower bound on the masses of newborn stars. Pockets of collapsing gas\nwith masses less than about one tenth of the Sun\u2019s have too little gravitational energy to raise their\ncore temperatures to the 10 million degrees required for the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. In that case,\nno nuclear-fusing star will be born; instead, we obtain a failed, would-be star\u2014an object that\nastronomers call a \u201cbrown dwarf.\u201d With no energy source of its own, a brown dwarf fades steadily,\nshining from the modest heat generated during the original collapse. The gaseous outer layers of a\nbrown dwarf are so cool that many of the large molecules normally destroyed in the atmospheres of\nhotter stars remain alive and well within them. Their feeble luminosities make brown dwarfs\nimmensely difficult to detect, so to find them, astrophysicists must employ complex methods similar\nto those they occasionally use to detect planets: searching for the faint infrared glow from these\nobjects. Only in recent years have astronomers discovered brown dwarfs in numbers sufficient to\nclassify them into more than one category.\nWe can also easily determine the upper mass limit to star formation. A star with a mass greater than\nabout a hundred times the Sun\u2019s will have a luminosity so great\u2014such an enormous outpouring of\nenergy in the form of visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet\u2014that any additional gas and dust attracted\ntoward the star will be pushed away by the intense pressure of starlight.

Even though most of the star formation that will ever occur in a typical giant galaxy like\nours has already taken place, we are fortunate that new stars continue to form, and will do so for\nmany billion years to come. Our good fortune lies in our ability to study the formation process and the\nyoungest stars, seeking clues that will reveal, in all its glory, the complete story of how stars pass\nfrom cold gas and dust to luminous maturity.\nHow old are the stars? No star wears its age on its sleeve, but some show their ages in their spectra.\nAmong the various means that astrophysicists have devised to judge the ages of stars, spectra forms\nthe most reliable hinge for analyzing the different colors of starlight in detail. Every color\u2014every\nwavelength and frequency of the light waves we observe\u2014tells a story about how matter made the\nstarlight, or affected that light as it left the star, or happened to lie along the line of sight between\nourselves and the star. Through close comparison with laboratory spectra, physicists have determined\nthe multitude of ways that different types of atoms and molecules affect the rainbow of colors in\nvisible light. They can apply this fertile knowledge to observations of stellar spectra, and deduce the\nnumbers of atoms and molecules that have affected light from a particular star, as well as the\ntemperature, pressure, and density of those particles. From years of comparing laboratory spectra\nwith the spectra of stars, together with laboratory studies of the spectra of different atoms and\nmolecules, astrophysicists have learned how to read an object\u2019s spectrum like a cosmic fingerprint,\none that reveals what physical conditions exist within a star\u2019s outer layers, the region from which\nlight streams directly outward into space. In addition, astrophysicists can determine how atoms and\nmolecules floating in interstellar space at much cooler temperatures may have affected the spectrum\nof the starlight they observe, and can likewise deduce the chemical composition, temperature, density,\nand pressure of this interstellar matter.\nIn this spectral analysis, each different type of atom or molecule has its own story to tell. The\npresence of molecules of any type, for example, revealed by their characteristic effects on certain\ncolors in the spectrum, demonstrates that the temperature in a star\u2019s outer layers must be less than\nabout 3,000\no\n Celsius (about 5,000\no\n Fahrenheit). At higher temperatures, molecules move so rapidly\nthat their collisions break them apart into individual atoms. By extending this type of analysis over\nmany different substances, astrophysicists can derive a nearly complete picture of the detailed\nconditions in stellar atmospheres. Some hard-working astrophysicists are said to know far more\nabout the spectra of stars they love than they do about their own families. This may have its down\nside for interpersonal relations even as it increases human understanding of the cosmos.\nOf all nature\u2019s elements\u2014of all the different types of atoms that can create patterns in a star\u2019s\nspectrum\u2014astrophysicists recognize and use one in particular to find the ages of the youngest stars.\nThat element is lithium, the third simplest and lightest in the periodic table, and familiar to some on\nEarth as the active ingredient of some antidepressant medications. In the periodic table of the\nelements, lithium occupies the position immediately after hydrogen and helium, which are deservedly\nfar more famous because they exist in immensely greater amounts throughout the cosmos. During its\nfirst few minutes, the universe fused hydrogen into helium nuclei in great numbers, but made only\nrelatively tiny amounts of any heavier nucleus. As a result, lithium remained a rather rare element,\ndistinguished among astrophysicists by the cosmic fact that stars hardly ever make more lithium, but", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3978, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e506185-4e30-4f00-8c9b-b02254114050": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e506185-4e30-4f00-8c9b-b02254114050", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e6018ea5-4ead-4ec0-8f65-e3576b3d9e5e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "567528cbfe603792ba5ac9a4e17e9dfc011c8b274fedd46ad6e48d4eba92fbe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "only destroy it. Lithium rides down a one-way street because every star has more effective nuclear\nfusion reactions to destroy lithium than to create it. As a result, the cosmic supply of lithium has\nsteadily decreased and continues to do so. If you want some, now would be a good time to acquire it.\nFor astrophysicists, this simple fact about lithium makes it a highly useful tool for measuring the\nages of stars. All stars begin their lives with their fair and proportionate share of lithium, left behind\nby the nuclear fusion that occurred during the universe\u2019s first half hour\u2014and during the big bang\nitself. And what is that fair share? About one in every 100 billion nuclei. After a newborn star begins\nits life with this \u201crichness\u201d of lithium, things go downhill, lithiumwise, as nuclear reactions within the\nstar\u2019s core slowly consume lithium nuclei. The steady and sometimes episodic mixing of matter in the\ncore with matter outside carries material outward, so that after thousands of years, the star\u2019s outer\nlayers can reflect what previously happened in its core.\nWhen astrophysicists look for the youngest stars, they therefore follow a simple rule: Look for the\nstars with the \ngreatest\n abundance of lithium. Each star\u2019s number of lithium nuclei in proportion to, for\nexample, hydrogen (determined from careful study of the star\u2019s spectrum), will locate the star at some\npoint along a graph that shows how stars\u2019 ages correlate with lithium in their outer layers. By using\nthis method, astrophysicists can identify, with confidence, the youngest stars in a cluster, and can\nassign each of those stars a lithium-based age. Because stars are efficient destroyers of lithium, older\nstars show little if any of the stuff. Hence the method works well only for stars less than few hundred\nmillion years old. But for these younger stars, the lithium approach works wonders. A recent study of\ntwo dozen young stars in the Orion nebula, all of which have masses close to the Sun\u2019s, show ages\nthat range between 1 and 10 million years. Some day astrophysicists may well identify still younger\nstars, but for now, 1 million years represents about the best they can do.\nExcept for dispersing\n the cocoons of gas from which they formed, groups of newborn stars bother nobody\nfor a long time, as they quietly fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores and destroy their lithium\nnuclei as part of their fusion reactions. But nothing lasts forever. Over many million years, in\nresponse to the continual gravitational perturbations from enormous clouds that pass by, most would-\nbe star clusters \u201cevaporate,\u201d as its members scatter into the general pool of stars in the galaxy.\nNearly 5 billion years after our star formed, the identity of the Sun\u2019s siblings has vanished, whether\nor not those stars remain alive. Of all the stars in the Milky Way and other galaxies, those with low\nmasses consume their fuel so slowly that they live practically forever. Intermediate-mass stars such as\nour Sun eventually turn into red giants, expanding their outer gas layers a hundredfold in size as they\nslide toward death. These outer layers become so tenuously connected to the star that they drift into\nspace, exposing a core of spent nuclear fuels that powered the stars\u2019 10-billion-year lives. The gas\nthat returns to space will be swept up by passing clouds, to participate in later rounds of star\nformation.\nDespite their rarity, the highest-mass stars hold nearly all the evolutionary cards.

In this paper, the four scientists created a theoretical and computational framework that freshly\ninterpreted and melded together forty years of musings by other scientists on two key topics: the\nsources of stellar energy and the transmutation of chemical elements.\nCosmic nuclear chemistry, the quest to understand how nuclear fusion makes and destroys different\ntypes of nuclei, has always been a messy business. The crucial questions have always included: How\ndo the various elements behave when various temperatures and pressures act upon them? Do the\nelements fuse or do they split? How easily do they do this? Do these processes liberate new kinetic\nenergy or absorb existing kinetic energy? And how do the processes differ for each element in the\nperiodic table?\nWhat does the periodic table of the elements mean to you?

Physicists can easily calculate collision cross sections for cement\nmixers, or double-wide mobile homes moving down the street on flatbed trucks, but they face greater\nchallenges in analyzing the behavior of tiny, elusive subatomic particles. A detailed understanding of\ncollision cross sections enables physicists to predict nuclear reaction rates and pathways.

Their\ndifficulties resemble what would happen if you tried to navigate your way through one city\u2019s subway\nsystem with another city\u2019s subway map as your guide: your basic theory would be correct, but the\ndetails could kill you.\nDespite their ignorance of accurate collision cross sections, scientists during the first half of the\ntwentieth century had long suspected that if exotic nuclear processes exist anywhere in the universe,\nthe centers of stars seemed likely places to find them. In 1920, the British theoretical astrophysicist\nSir Arthur Eddington published a paper entitled the \u201cThe Internal Constitution of the Stars,\u201d in which\nhe argued that the Cavendish Laboratory in England, the leading center for atomic and nuclear physics\nresearch, could not be the only place in the universe that managed to change some elements into\nothers:\nBut is it possible to admit that such a transmutation is occurring?

I think that the suspicion has been generally\nentertained that the stars are the crucibles in which the lighter atoms which abound in the nebul\u00e6\nare compounded into more complex elements.\nEddington\u2019s paper, which foreshadowed the detailed research of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and\nHoyle, appeared several years before the discovery of quantum mechanics, without which our\nunderstanding of the physics of atoms and nuclei must be judged feeble at best. With remarkable\nprescience, Eddington began to formulate a scenario for star-generated energy via the thermonuclear\nfusion of hydrogen to helium and beyond:\nWe need not bind ourselves to the formation of helium from hydrogen as the sole reaction which\nsupplies the energy [to a star], although it would seem that the further stages in building up the\nelements involve much less liberation, and sometimes even absorption, of energy. The position\nmay be summarised in these terms: the atoms of all elements are built of hydrogen atoms bound\ntogether, and presumably have at one time been formed from hydrogen; the interior of a star seems\nas likely a place as any for the evolution to have occurred.\nAny model of the transmutation of the elements ought to explain the observed mix of elements found\non Earth and elsewhere in the universe. To do this, physicists needed to find the fundamental process\nwith which stars generate energy by turning one element into another.

Harkins published a paper noting that\n\u201celements of low atomic weight [the number of protons plus neutrons in each nucleus] are more\nabundant than those of high atomic weight and that, on the average, the elements with even atomic\nnumbers [the numbers of protons in each atomic nucleus] are about 10 times more abundant than those\nwith odd atomic numbers of similar value.\u201d Harkins surmised that the relative abundances of the\nelements depend on nuclear fusion rather than on chemical processes such as combustion, and that the\nheavy elements must have been synthesized from the light ones.\nThe detailed mechanism of nuclear fusion in stars could ultimately explain the cosmic presence of\nmany elements, especially those that you will obtain each time you add the two-proton, two-neutron\nhelium nucleus to your previously forged element. These constitute the abundant elements with \u201ceven\natomic numbers\u201d that Harkins described. But the existence and relative numbers of many other\nelements remained unexplained. Some other means of element buildup must have been at work in the\ncosmos.\nThe neutron, discovered in 1932 by the British physicist James Chadwick while working at the\nCavendish Laboratories, plays a significant role in nuclear fusion that Eddington could not have\nimagined. To assemble protons requires hard work, because protons naturally repel one another, as\ndo all particles with the same sign of electric charge. To fuse protons, you must bring them\nsufficiently close (often by way of high temperatures, pressures, and densities) to overcome their\nmutual repulsion for the strong nuclear force to bind them together. The chargeless neutron, however,\nrepels no other particle, so it can simply march into somebody else\u2019s nucleus and join the other\nassembled particles, held there by the same force that binds the protons. This step does not create\nanother element, which is defined by a different number of \nprotons\n in each nucleus. By adding a\nneutron, we make an \u201cisotope\u201d of the nucleus of the original element, which differs only in detail from\nthe original nucleus because its total electric charge remains unchanged. For some elements, the\nfreshly captured neutron proves to be unstable once it joins the nucleus. In that case, the neutron\nspontaneously converts itself into a proton (which stays put in the nucleus), and an electron (which\nescapes immediately). In this way, like the Greek soldiers who breached the walls of Troy by hiding\ninside a wooden horse, protons can sneak into a nucleus in the guise of neutrons.\nIf the ongoing flow of neutrons stays high, each nucleus can absorb many neutrons before the first\none decays. These rapidly absorbed neutrons help to create an ensemble of elements whose origin is\nidentified with the \u201crapid neutron capture process,\u201d and differ from the assortment of elements that\nresult when neutrons are captured slowly, where each successive neutron decays into a proton before\nthe nucleus captures the next one.\nBoth the rapid and the slow neutron capture processes are responsible for creating many of the\nelements not otherwise formed through traditional thermonuclear fusion.

As already noted, after converting its hydrogen into helium, the core of a\nmassive star will next fuse helium into carbon, then carbon to oxygen, oxygen to neon, and so forth up\nto iron. To successively fuse this sequence of heavier and heavier elements requires successively\nhigher temperatures for the nuclei to overcome their natural repulsion. Fortunately this happens all by\nitself, because at the end of each intermediate stage, when the star\u2019s energy source temporarily shuts\noff, the inner regions collapse, the temperature rises, and the next pathway of fusion kicks in. Since\nnothing lasts forever, the star eventually confronts one enormous problem: The fusion of iron does not\nrelease energy, but instead absorbs it. This brings bad news to the star, which can now no longer\nsupport itself against gravity by pulling a new energy-releasing process out of its nuclear fusion hat.\nAt this point, the star suddenly collapses, forcing its internal temperature to rise so rapidly that a\ngigantic explosion ensues as the star blows its guts to smithereens.\nThroughout each explosion, the availability of neutrons, protons, and energy allows the supernova to\ncreate elements in many different ways. In their 1957 article, Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle\ncombined (1) the well-tested tenets of quantum mechanics; (2) the physics of explosions; (3) the latest\ncollision cross sections; (4) the varied processes that transmute elements into one another; and (5) the\nbasics of stellar evolutionary theory to implicate supernova explosions decisively as the primary\nsource of all the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the universe.\nWith high-mass stars as the source of heavy elements, and supernovae as the smoking gun of element\ndistribution, the fab \nfour acquired the solution to one other problem for free: when you forge elements\nheavier than hydrogen and helium in stellar cores, you do the rest of the universe no good unless you\nsomehow cast those elements forth into interstellar space, making them available to form worlds with\nwombats. Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle unified our understanding of nuclear fusion in stars\nwith the element production visible throughout the universe.

No, we have not solved all of our cosmic chemical\nquestions. A curious contemporary mystery involves the element technetium, which, in 1937, was the\nfirst element to be created artificially in Earthbound laboratories. (The word \u201ctechnetium,\u201d along\nwith others that use the prefix \u201ctech-,\u201d derive from the Greek \ntechnetos\n, which translates to\n\u201cartificial.\u201d) We have yet to discover technetium on Earth, but astronomers have found it in the\natmospheres of a small fraction of the red giant stars in our galaxy. This would hardly surprise us,\nwere it not for the fact that technetium decays to form other elements, and does so with a half-life of a\nmere 2 million years, far shorter than the age and life expectancy of the stars in which we observe it.\nThis conundrum has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus within the community of\nastrophysicists.\nRed giants with these peculiar chemical properties are rare, but sufficiently nettlesome for a cadre\nof astrophysicists (mostly spectroscopists) who specialize in the subject to generate and distribute the\nNewsletter of\n \nChemically Peculiar Red Giant Stars\n.

We shall grasp that chance and dance our way across the table, saluting its most\ndistinguished entries and admiring its little oddities.\nThe periodic table emphasizes the fact that each of nature\u2019s elements distinguishes itself from all\nothers by its \u201catomic number,\u201d the number of protons (positive electric charges) in each nucleus of\nthat element. Complete atoms always have a number of electrons (negative electric charges) orbiting\nthe nucleus equal to the element\u2019s atomic number, so the total atom has zero electric charge.

About 1 percent of the mass involved in this fusion\ntransforms itself into energy, leaving the other 99 percent in the form of helium.\nHelium\n, the second most abundant element in the universe, can be found on Earth only in a few\nunderground pockets that trap this gas. Most of us know only helium\u2019s whimsical side, available for\ntesting through over-the-counter purchases. When you inhale helium, its low density in comparison\nwith atmospheric gases increases the vibrational frequency within your windpipe, causing you to\nsound like Mickey Mouse. The cosmos contains four times more helium than all other elements\ncombined (not counting hydrogen). One of the pillars of big bang cosmology is the prediction that\nthroughout the cosmos, no fewer than about 8 percent of all atoms are helium, which the well-mixed\nprimeval fireball manufactured during its immediate post-birth pangs. Since the thermonuclear fusion\nof hydrogen within stars produces additional helium, some regions of the cosmos can accumulate\nmore than their initial 8 percent share of helium, but\u2014just as the big bang model predicts\u2014no one\nhas ever found a region of our galaxy or anybody else\u2019s galaxy with less.\nSome thirty years before they discovered and isolated helium on Earth, astrophysicists had detected\nhelium in the Sun by the telltale features that they saw in the Sun\u2019s spectrum of light during the total\neclipse of 1868. They naturally named this previously unknown material helium after Helios, the\nGreek sun god. With 92 percent of hydrogen\u2019s buoyancy in air, but without the explosive\ncharacteristics of hydrogen that destroyed the German \nHindenburg\n dirigible, helium provides the gas\nof choice for the outsized balloon characters of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, making the\nfamed department store second only to the U.S. military as the world\u2019s top consumer of helium.\nLithium\n, the third simplest element in the universe, has three protons in each nucleus. Like hydrogen\nand helium, lithium was made soon after the big bang, but unlike helium, which is often made in\nsubsequent nuclear reactions, lithium will be \ndestroyed\n by every nuclear reaction that occurs in stars.\nHence we expect to find no object or region with lithium present in more than the relatively small\nrelative abundances\u2014no more than 0.0001 percent of the total\u2014produced in the early universe. As\npredicted by our model of element formation during the first half hour, no one has yet found a galaxy\nwith more lithium than this upper limit. The combination of the upper limit on helium and the lower\nlimit on lithium furnishes us with a potent dual constraint to apply in testing the theory of big bang\ncosmology. A similar test of the big bang model of the universe, which it has passed with flying\ncolors, compares the abundance of deuterium nuclei, each of which has one proton and one neutron,\nwith the amount of ordinary hydrogen. Fusion during the first few minutes produced both of these\nnuclei, but made far more of simple hydrogen (just one proton).\nLike lithium, the next two elements in the periodic table, \nberyllium\n and \nboron\n (with four and five\nprotons, respectively, in each nucleus) owe their origin mainly to thermonuclear fusion in the early\nuniverse, and they appear only in relatively modest numbers throughout the cosmos.

With twenty-six\nprotons and at least as many neutrons in its nucleus, iron has a distinctive quality that derives from the\nquantum mechanics rules that govern how protons and neutrons interact: Iron nuclei have the highest\nbinding energy per nuclear particle (proton or neutron). This means something quite simple. If you\nseek to split iron nuclei (in what physicists call \u201cfission\u201d), you must provide them with additional\nenergy. On the other hand, if you combine iron atoms (a process called \u201cfusion\u201d), they will also\nabsorb energy. It takes energy to fuse iron nuclei and it takes energy to split them apart. For all other\nelements, only one or the other half of this dual description applies.\nStars, however, are in the business of using \nE = mc\n2\n to turn mass into energy, which they must do to\noppose their tendency to collapse under their own gravity. When stars fuse nuclei in their cores,\nnature demands, and obtains, nuclear fusion that releases energy. By the time that a massive star fuses\nmost of the nuclei in its core into iron, it has exhausted all its options for using thermonuclear fusion\nto generate energy, because any further fusion will require rather than release energy. Deprived of a\nsource of energy from thermonuclear fusion, the star\u2019s core will collapse under its own weight, then\ninstantly rebound in a titanic explosion known as a supernova, outshining a billion suns for more than\na week. Such supernovae occur because of the special property of iron nuclei\u2014their refusal either to\nfuse or to split without an input of energy.\nBy describing hydrogen, helium; lithium, beryllium, and boron; carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen; and\naluminum, titanium, and iron, we have surveyed nearly all of the key elements that make the cosmos\u2014\nand life on Earth\u2014go round.\nSimply for the cosmic hell of it, let\u2019s have a quick look at some far more obscure entries on the\nperiodic table.

Two years later, another planet was found, orbiting the Sun within the same gap as Ceres.\nThis object received the name Pallas, from the Roman goddess of wisdom; like cerium before it, the\nnext element discovered thereafter was named \npalladium\n in its honor. The naming party ended a few\ndecades later, after dozens more of these planets were discovered in much the same location, and\nafter closer analysis revealed that these objects are much, much smaller than the smallest known\nplanets. A new swath of real estate had come into view within the solar system, consisting of small,\ncraggy chunks of rock and metal. Ceres and Pallas turned out to be not planets but asteroids, objects\nonly a few hundred miles across. They live in the asteroid belt, now known to contain millions of\nobjects, of which astronomers have catalogued and named upward of fifteen thousand\u2014somewhat\nmore than the number of elements in the periodic table.\nThe metal \nmercury\n, which assumes a viscous liquid form at room temperature, owes its name to the\nspeedy Roman messenger god. So too does the planet Mercury, the fastest-moving of all the planets in\nthe solar system.\nThorium\n\u2019s name comes from Thor, the hammer-and-thunder-wielding Scandinavian god, who\ncorresponds to the lightning-bolt-wielding Jupiter in Roman mythology.

The element \nuranium\n, discovered in 1789, received its name in honor of\nWilliam Herschel\u2019s planet, discovered by him just eight years earlier. All isotopes of uranium are\nunstable, spontaneously but slowly decaying to lighter elements, a process accompanied by the\nrelease of energy. If you can arrange to speed up the rate of decay with a \u201cchain reaction\u201d among\nuranium nuclei, you have the explosive energy release required for a bomb. In 1945, the United States\nexploded the first uranium bomb (familiarly called an atomic bomb or A-bomb) to be used in\nwarfare, incinerating the Japanese city of Hiroshima. With ninety-two protons packed in each nucleus,\nuranium wins the prize as the largest and heaviest element to occur naturally, although trace amounts\nof still larger and heavier elements appear in places where uranium ore is mined.\nIf Uranus merited an element, so did Neptune. Unlike uranium, however, which was identified soon\nafter its planet, neptunium was discovered in 1940 in the particle accelerator called the Berkeley\nCyclotron, ninety-seven years after the German astron-omer John Galle found Neptune in a spot on the\nsky predicted as the most likely spot by the French mathematician Joseph Le Verrier, who studied\nUranus\u2019 unexplained orbital behavior and deduced the existence of a farther planet.

As our measurements of Pluto\u2019s size improved, Pluto kept getting\nsmaller. Our knowledge of Pluto\u2019s dimensions did not stabilize until the late 1970s, during the\nVoyager\n missions to the outer solar system.

One pound of this plutonium will generate 10\nmillion kilowatt-hours of heat energy, sufficient to power a household light bulb for eleven thousand\nyears, or a human being for just about as long.

Each of these origin stories fills a vital role, not only in explaining how an\napparently formless cosmos produced complex assemblages of different types of objects but also in\ndetermining how and why, 14 billion years after the big bang, we now find ourselves alive on Earth\nto ask, How did this all happen?\nThese mysteries arise in large part because during the cosmic \u201cdark ages,\u201d when matter was just\nbeginning to organize itself into self-contained units such as stars and galaxies, most of this matter\ngenerated little or no detectable radiation. The dark ages have left us with only the barest\npossibilities, still imperfectly explored, for observing matter during its early stages of organization.\nThis in turn implies that we must rely, to an uneasily large extent, on our theories of how matter ought\nto behave, with relatively few points at which we can check these theories against observational data.\nWhen we turn to the origin of planets, the mysteries deepen. We lack not only \nobservations\n of the\ncrucial, initial stages of planetary formation but also successful \ntheories\n of how the planets began to\nform. To celebrate the positive, we note that the question, What made the planets?, has grown\nconsiderably broader in recent years. Throughout most of the twentieth century, this question centered\non the Sun\u2019s family of planets. During the past decade, having discovered more than a hundred\n\u201cexosolar\u201d planets around relatively nearby stars, astrophysicists have acquired significantly more\ndata from which to deduce the early history of planets, and in particular to determine how these\nastronomically small, dark, and dense objects formed along with the stars that give them light and life.\nAstrnophysicists may now\n have more data, but they have no better answers than before. Indeed, the\ndiscovery of exosolar planets, many of which move in orbits far different from those of the Sun\u2019s\nplanets, has in many ways confused the issue, leaving the story of planet formation no closer to\nclosure. In simple summary, we can state that no good explanation exists of how the planets \nbegan\n to\nbuild themselves from gas and dust, though we can easily perceive how the formation process, once\nwell underway, made larger objects from smaller ones, and did so within a rather brief span of time.\nThe beginnings of planet building pose a remarkably intract-able problem, to the point that one of\nthe world\u2019s experts on the subject, Scott Tremaine of Princeton University, has elucidated (partly in\njest) Tremaine\u2019s laws of planet formation.

In its broad\noutlines, Kant\u2019s hypothesis remains the basis for modern astronomical approaches to planet\nformation, having triumphed over the concept, much in vogue during the first half of the twentieth\ncentury, that the Sun\u2019s planets arose from a close passage of another star by the Sun. In that scenario,\nthe gravitational forces between the stars would have drawn masses of gas from each of them, and\nsome of this gas could then have cooled and condensed to form the planets. This hypothesis, promoted\nby the famed British astrophysicist James Jeans, had the defect (or the appeal, for those inclined in\nthat direction) of making planetary systems extremely rare, because sufficiently close encounters\nbetween stars probably occur only a few times during the lifetime of an entire galaxy. Once\nastronomers calculated that almost all the gas pulled from the stars would evaporate rather than\ncondense, they abandoned Jeans\u2019s hypothesis and returned to Kant\u2019s, which implies that many, if not\nmost, stars should have planets in orbit around them.\nAstrophysicists now have good evidence that stars form, not one by one but by the thousands and\ntens of thousands, within giant clouds of gas and dust that may eventually give birth to about a million\nindividual stars. One of these giant stellar nurseries has produced the Orion nebula, the closest large\nstar-forming region to the solar system. Within a few million years, this region will have produced\nhundreds of thousands of new stars, which will blow most of the nebula\u2019s remaining gas and dust into\nspace, so that astronomers a hundred thousand generations from now will observe the young stars\nunencumbered by the remnants of their starbirthing cocoons.\nAstrophysicists now use radio telescopes to map the distribution of cool gas and dust in the\nimmediate vicinities of young stars. Their maps typically show that young stars do not sail through\nspace devoid of all surrounding matter; instead, the stars usually have orbiting disks of matter, similar\nin size to the solar system, but made of hydrogen gas (and of other gases in lesser abundances)\nsprinkled throughout with dust particles. The term \u201cdust\u201d describes groups of particles that each\ncontain several million atoms and have sizes much smaller than that of the period that ends this\nsentence. Many of these dust grains consist primarily of carbon atoms, linked together to form\ngraphite (the chief constituent of the \u201clead\u201d in a pencil). Others are mixtures of silicon and oxygen\natoms\u2014in essence tiny rocks, with mantles of ice surrounding their stony cores.\nThe formation of these dust particles in interstellar space has its own mysteries and detailed\ntheories, which we may skip past with the happy thought that the cosmos \nis\n dusty. To make this dust,\natoms have come together by the millions; in view of the extremely low densities between the stars,\nthe likeliest sites for this process seem to be the extended outer atmospheres of cool stars, which\ngently blow material into space.\nThe production of \ninterstellar dust particles provides an essential first step on the road to planets. This\nholds true not only for solid planets like our own but also for gas-giant planets, typified in the Sun\u2019s\nfamily by Jupiter and Saturn.

In these\nplanets, with fifteen and seventeen times Earth\u2019s mass, respectively, the core may contain more than\nhalf of the planet\u2019s mass.\nFor all four of these planets, and presumably for all of the giant planets recently discovered around\nother stars, the planetary cores played an essential role in the formation process: First came the core,\nand then came the gas, attracted by the solid core. Thus all planet formation requires that a large lump\nof solid matter must form first. Of the Sun\u2019s planets, Jupiter has the largest of these cores, Saturn the\nnext largest, Neptune the next, Uranus after that, and Earth ranks fifth, just as it does in total size. The\nformation histories of all the planets pose a fundamental question: How does nature make dust\ncoagulate to form clumps of matter many thousand miles across?\nThe answer has two parts, one known and one unknown, with the unknown part, not surprisingly,\ncloser to the origin. Once you form objects half a mile across, which astronomers call planetesimals,\neach of them will have sufficiently strong gravity to attract other such objects successfully. The mutual\ngravitational forces among planetesimals will build first planetary cores and then planets at a brisk\npace, so that a few million years will take you from a host of clumps, each the size of a small town, to\nentire new worlds, ripe to acquire either a thin coat of atmospheric gases (in the case of Venus, Earth,\nand Mars) or an immensely thick one of hydrogen and helium (for the four gas-giant planets, which\norbit the Sun at distances large enough for them to accumulate huge quantities of these two lightest\ngases). To astrophysicists, the transition from half-mile-wide planetesimals to planets reduces to a\nseries of well-understood computer models that produce a wide variety of planetary details, but\nalmost always yield inner planets that are small, rocky, and dense, as well as outer planets that are\nlarge and (except for their cores) gaseous and rarefied. During this process, many of the\nplanetesimals, as well as some of the larger objects that they make, find themselves flung entirely out\nof the solar system by gravitational interactions with still larger objects.\nAll this works rather well on a computer, but building the half-mile-wide planetesimals in the first\nplace still lies beyond astrophysicists\u2019 present abilities to integrate their knowledge of physics with\ntheir computer programs. Gravity can\u2019t make planetesimals, because the modest gravitational forces\nbetween small objects won\u2019t hold them together effectively. Two theoretical possibilities exist for\nmaking planetesimals from dust, neither of them highly satisfactory. One model proposes the\nformation of planetesimals through accretion, which occurs when dust particles collide and stick\ntogether. Accretion works well in principle, because most dust particles \ndo\n stick together when they\nmeet. This explains the origin of dust bunnies under your couch, and if you imagine superdust bunnies\ngrowing around the Sun, you can, with only minimal mental effort, let them grow to become chair-\nsized, house-sized, block-sized, and before long the size of planetesimals, ready for serious\ngravitational action.\nUnfortunately, unlike the production of actual bunnies, the dust-bunny growth of planetesimals seems\nto require far too much time.

The accretion process requires significantly longer than a\nfew tens of millions of years to make planetesimals from dust; so unless astrophysicists have missed\nsomething important in understanding how dust accumulates to build large structures, we need another\nmechanism to surmount the time barriers to planetesimal formation.\nThat other mechanism may consist of giant vortices that sweep up dust particles by the trillions,\nwhirling them quickly toward their happy agglomeration into significantly larger objects. Because the\ncontracting cloud of gas and dust that became the Sun and its planets apparently acquired some\nrotation, it soon changed its overall shape from spherical to platelike, leaving the Sun-in-formation as\na relatively dense contracting sphere at the center, surrounded by a highly flattened disk of material in\norbit around that sphere. To this day, the orbits of the Sun\u2019s planets, which all follow the same\ndirection and lie in nearly the same plane, testify to a disklike distribution of the matter that built the\nplanetesimals and planets. Within such a rotating disk, astrophysicists envision the appearance of\nrippling \u201cinstabilities,\u201d alternating regions of greater and lesser density. The denser parts of these\ninstabilities collect both gaseous material and dust that floats within the gas. Within a few thousand\nyears, these instabilities become swirling vortices that can sweep large amounts of dust into\nrelatively small volumes.\nThis vortex model for the formation of planetesimals shows promise, though it has not yet won the\nhearts of those who seek explanations of how the solar system produced what young planets need.\nUpon detailed examination, the model provides better explanations for the cores of Jupiter and Saturn\nthan for those of Uranus and Neptune. Because astronomers have no way to prove that the instabilities\nneeded for the model to work actually did occur, we must refrain from passing judgment ourselves.\nThe existence of numerous small asteroids and comets, which resemble planetesimals in their sizes\nand compositions, support the concept that billions of years ago, planetesimals by the millions built\nthe planets. Let us therefore regard the formation of planetesimals as an established, if poorly\nunderstood, phenomenon that somehow bridges a key gap in our knowledge, leaving us ready to\nadmire what happens when planetesimals collide.\nIn this scenario, \nwe can easily imagine that once the gas and dust surrounding the Sun had formed a few\ntrillion planetesimals, this armada of objects collided, built larger objects, and eventually created the\nSun\u2019s four inner planets and the cores of its four giant planets. We should not overlook the planets\u2019\nmoons, smaller objects that orbit all of the Sun\u2019s planets except the innermost, Mercury and Venus.\nThe largest of these moons, with diameters of a few hundred to a few thousand miles, appear to fit\nnicely into the model that we have created, because they presumably also arose from planetesimal\ncollisions. Moon building ceased once collisions had built the satellite worlds to their present sizes,\nno doubt (we may assume) because by that time the nearby planets, with their stronger gravity, had\ntaken possession of most of the nearby planetesimals.

The smallest of these moons, less than a mile across,\nmay again be naked planetesimals, deprived of any further collisional growth by the presence of\nnearby objects that had already grown much larger. In each of these four families of satellites, almost\nall of the larger moons orbit the planet in the same direction and in nearly the same plane. We can\nhardly refrain from explaining this result with the same cause that made the planets orbit in the same\ndirection and nearly the same plane: Around each planet, a rotating cloud of gas and dust produced\nclumps of matter, which grew to planetesimal and then to moon sizes.\nIn the inner solar system, only our Earth has a sizable moon. Mercury and Venus have none, while\nMars\u2019 two potato-shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, each span only a few miles, and should\ntherefore represent the earliest stages of forming larger objects from planetesimals.

Did the Moon also grow from planetesimal collisions, as the four inner planets did?\nThis seemed quite a reasonable supposition until humans brought lunar rocks back to Earth for\ndetailed examination. More than three decades ago, the chemical composition of the rock samples\nreturned by the \nApollo\n missions imposed two conclusions, one on either side of the possibilities for\nthe Moon\u2019s origin. On the one hand, the composition of these Moon rocks resembles that of rocks on\nEarth so closely that the hypothesis that our satellite formed entirely apart from us no longer seems\ntenable. On the other hand, the Moon\u2019s composition differs from Earth\u2019s just enough to prove that the\nMoon did not entirely form from terrestrial material. But if the Moon did not form apart from Earth,\nand was not made from Earth, how did it form?\nThe current answer to this conundrum, amazing though it may seem on its surface, builds upon a\nonce popular hypothesis that the Moon formed as the result of a giant impact, early in the history of\nthe solar system, that scooped material out of the Pacific Basin and flung it into space, where it\ncoalesced to form our satellite. Under the new view, which has already gained wide acceptance as\nthe best available explanation, the Moon \ndid\n form as the result of a giant object that struck Earth, but\nthe object striking Earth was so large\u2014about the size of Mars\u2014that it naturally added some of its\nmaterial to the matter ejected from Earth. Much of the material thrown into space by the force of the\nimpact might have vanished from our immediate vicinity, but enough remained behind to coagulate\ninto our familiar Moon, made of Earth plus foreign matter. All of this occurred 4.5 billion years ago,\nduring the first 100 million years after the formation of the planets began.\nIf a Mars-sized object struck Earth in that bygone era, where is it today? The impact could hardly\nhave knocked the object into pieces so small that we cannot observe them: our finest telescopes can\nfind objects in the inner solar system as small as the planetesimals that built the planets.

This result, however, assumes that\ninterplanetary space is essentially empty. Viewed close up, however, the spaces between the planets\nturn out to contain all manner of chunky rocks, pebbles, ice balls, dust, streams of charged particles,\nand far-flung man-made probes. Interplanetary space is also permeated by immensely powerful\ngravitational and magnetic fields, invisible but nonetheless quite capable of affecting the objects in\nour neighborhood. These small objects and cosmic force fields present a serious ongoing threat to\nanyone who attempts to travel from place to place in the solar system.

Nearly all of this matter burns in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, slamming into\nthe air with so much energy that the incoming particles vaporize. Our frail species evolved beneath\nthis protective blanket of air. Larger, golf-ball-size pieces of debris heat rapidly but unevenly, and\noften shatter into many smaller pieces before they vaporize. Still larger pieces singe their surfaces but\notherwise make their way, at least in part, down to the ground. You might think that by now, after 4.6\nbillion trips around the Sun, Earth would have \u201cvacuumed\u201d up all possible debris in its orbital path.\nWe have made progress in this direction: things were once much worse. During the first half billion\nyears after the formation of the Sun and its planets, so much junk rained down on Earth that the impact\nenergy generated a strongly heated atmosphere and a sterilized surface.\nIn particular, one hunk of space junk was so substantial that it led to the formation of the Moon.

Perhaps the same amount of debris reaches Earth from the\nMoon. Thus we did not have to go to the Moon to retrieve Moon rocks. A few dozen of them have\ncome to us on Earth, although they are not of our choosing, and we had not yet learned this fact during\nthe \nApollo\n program.\nIf Mars ever harbored life\u2014most likely billions of years ago when liquid water flowed freely on\nthe Martian surface\u2014then unsuspecting bacteria, stowed away in the nooks and crannies (especially\nin the crannies) of the rock ejected from Mars, could have traveled to Earth for free. We already\nknow that some varieties of bacteria can survive long periods of hibernation, as well as high doses of\nthe solar ionizing radiation to which they would be exposed en route to Earth. The existence of space-\nborne bacteria is neither a crazy idea nor pure science fiction. The concept even has an important-\nsounding name: panspermia.

This fact might\nseem to obviate environmental concerns over astronauts who sneeze on the Martian surface,\nspreading their germs on the alien landscape. In reality, even if we are all Martian in origin, we\nwould dearly like to trace life\u2019s trajectory from Mars to Earth, so these concerns retain vital\nimportance.\nMost of the solar system\u2019s asteroids live and work in the \u201cmain belt,\u201d a flattened region around the\nSun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. By tradition, asteroid discoverers get to name their\nobjects as they choose. Often pictured by artists as a cluttered region of rocks floating in the plane of\nthe solar system, though in fact spread out over millions of miles at different distances from the Sun,\nthe objects in the asteroid belt have a total mass less than 5 percent of the Moon\u2019s, which itself has\nbarely more than 1 percent of Earth\u2019s mass. Sounds insignificant at first, but the asteroids quietly pose\na long-term cosmic threat to our planet. Accumulated perturbations of their orbits continually create a\ndeadly subset of asteroids, perhaps a few thousand in number, whose elongated paths carry them so\nclose to the Sun that they intersect the orbit of Earth, creating the possibility of collision. A back-of-\nthe-envelope calculation demonstrates that most of these Earth-crossing asteroids will strike Earth\nwithin a few hundred million years. The objects larger than about a mile across carry enough energy\nto destabilize Earth\u2019s ecosystem and to put most of Earth\u2019s land species at risk of extinction. That\nwould be bad.\nMeanwhile, asteroids are not the only space objects that pose a risk to life on Earth. The Dutch\nastronomer Jan Oort first recognized that within the cold depths of interstellar space, much farther\nfrom the Sun than any planet, a host of frozen leftovers from the solar system\u2019s earliest stages of\nformation still orbit our star.

As in the asteroid belt, a subset of the Kuiper Belt objects travel on\neccentric orbits that cross the paths of other planets.

For this\nreason, fast-moving metal space probes \ncan have electrical currents induced within them. These\ncurrents interact with the local magnetic field in a way that retards the space probe\u2019s motion.

Both \nPioneer\n \n10\n and \nPioneer\n \n11\n, launched during the 1970s, have not traveled quite so far\ninto space as our dynamical models of their motions predict.

Moving in orbits that precisely\nmatch Earth\u2019s rotation rate, these satellites appear to \u201chover\u201d above a single point on the Equator, a\nfact that makes them ideal for relaying signals from one part of Earth\u2019s surface to another.\nNewton\u2019s law of gravity states that, although the gravity from a planet gets progressively weaker as\nyou travel farther from it, no distance will reduce the force of gravity all the way to zero, and that an\nobject with enormous mass can exert significant gravitational forces even at large distances. The\nplanet Jupiter, with its mighty gravitational field, bats out of harm\u2019s way many comets that would\notherwise wreak havoc on the inner solar system. By doing so, Jupiter acts as a gravitational shield\nfor Earth, allowing long (50- to 100-million-year) stretches of relative peace and quiet on Earth.\nWithout Jupiter\u2019s protection, complex life would have a hard time growing interestingly complex,\nalways living at the risk of extinction from a devastating impact.\nWe have exploited the gravitational fields of planets for nearly every probe sent into space. The\nCassini\n probe, for example, sent to Saturn for an encounter late in 2004, was launched from Earth on\nOctober 15, 1997, and was gravitationally assisted twice by Venus, once by Earth (on a return flyby),\nand once by Jupiter. Like a multi-cushion billiard shot, trajectories from one planet to another using\ngravitational slingshots are common. Otherwise our tiny probes would not have enough speed and\nenergy to reach their destinations.\nOne of us is now accountable for a piece of the solar system\u2019s interplanetary debris. In November\n2000, the main-belt asteroid 1994KA, discovered by David Levy and Caroline Shoemaker, was\nnamed \u201c13123 Tyson.\u201d A fun distinction, but there\u2019s no particular reason to get big-headed about it; as\nalready noted, plenty of asteroids have familiar names such as Jody, Harriet, and Thomas. And plenty\nof other asteroids have names such as Merlin, James Bond, and Santa. Rising through 20,000, the\ncount of asteroids with well-established orbits (the criterion for assigning them names and numbers)\nmay soon challenge our capacity to name them. Whether or not that day arrives, there is curious\ncomfort knowing that one\u2019s own chunk of cosmic debris is not alone, as it litters the space between\nthe planets, joined by a long list of other chunks named for real and fictional people.\nWhen last checked, asteroid 13123 Tyson was not headed toward us, and so cannot be blamed for\neither ending or starting life on Earth.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3602, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb9258ac-f3ca-4700-8417-5a6716d0eb19": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb9258ac-f3ca-4700-8417-5a6716d0eb19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16d6073e-f09c-444d-84ab-347c3c68667e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "19b29f1c7206758f9384028b77fc3ffddb7fc7e3dc9ca162f641e225b40c3dd7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "CHAPTER 13\nWorlds Unnumbered\nPlanets Beyond the Solar System\n         Thro\u2019 worlds unnumbered tho\u2019 the God be known,\n         \u2019Tis ours to trace him only in our own.\n         He, who through vast immensity can pierce,\n         See worlds on worlds compose one universe,\n         Observe how system into system runs\n         What other planets circle other suns,\n         What varied Being peoples ev\u2019ry star,\n         May tell why Heav\u2019n has made us as we are.\n\u2014Alexander Pope, \nAn Essay on Man\n (1733)\nN\nearly five centuries ago, Nicolaus Copernicus resurrected a hypothesis that the ancient Greek\nastronomer Aristarchus had first suggested. Far from occupying the center of the cosmos, said\nCopernicus, Earth belongs to the family of planets that orbit the Sun.\nEven though a majority of humans have yet to accept this fact, believing in their hearts that Earth\nremains immobile as the heavens turn around her, astronomers have long offered convincing\narguments that Copernicus wrote the truth about the nature of our cosmic home. The conclusion that\nEarth ranks as just one of the Sun\u2019s planets immediately suggests that other planets fundamentally\nresemble our own, and that they may well possess their own inhabitants, endowed as we are with\nplans and dreams, work, play, and fantasy.\nFor many centuries, astronomers who used telescopes to observe hundreds of thousands of\nindividual stars lacked the ability to discern whether or not any of these stars have planets of their\nown. Their observations did reveal that our Sun ranks as an entirely representative star, whose near\ntwins exist in great numbers throughout our Milky Way galaxy. If the Sun has a planetary family, so too\nmight other stars, with their planets equally capable of giving life to creatures of all possible forms.\nExpressing this view in a manner that affronted papal authority brought Giordano Bruno to his death\nat the stake in 1600. Today, a tourist can pick his way through the crowds at the outdoor caf\u00e9s in\nRome\u2019s Campo di Fiori to reach Bruno\u2019s statue at its center, then pause for a moment to reflect on the\npower of ideas (if not the power of those who hold them) to triumph over those who would suppress\nthem.\nAs Bruno\u2019s fate helps to illustrate, imagining life on other worlds ranks among the most powerful\nideas ever to enter human minds. Were this not so, Bruno would have lived to a riper age, and NASA\nwould find itself shorter of funds. Thus speculation about life on other worlds has focused throughout\nhistory, as NASA\u2019s attention still does, on the planets that orbit the Sun. In our search for life beyond\nEarth, however, a great frost has appeared: none of the other worlds in our solar system seem\nparticularly fit for life.\nAlthough this conclusion hardly does justice to the myriad possible paths by which life might arise", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2823, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de9f430c-5e2b-4b10-b11a-c0a81a541a9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "de9f430c-5e2b-4b10-b11a-c0a81a541a9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54ece205-9b21-491b-8b0d-4cdc73cdc9cb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "67d1927df6b45c552fa45597115c20dae276065801c81204a30f2f313ecb3e64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "and maintain itself, the fact remains that our initial explorations of Mars and Venus, as well as of\nJupiter and its large moons, have failed to produce any convincing signs of life.

Much more\nsearching remains to be done, and fortunately (for those who engage themselves mentally in this\neffort) continues to be underway, especially in the hunt for life on Mars. Nevertheless, the verdict on\nextraterrestrial life in the solar system shows enough likelihood of proving negative that supple minds\nnow usually look beyond our cosmic neighborhood, to the vast array of possible worlds that orbit\nstars other than our Sun.\nUntil 1995, speculation\n about planets around other stars could proceed almost entirely unfettered by facts.\nWith the exception of a few pieces of Earth-sized debris in orbit around the remnants of exploded\nstars, which almost certainly formed after the supernova explosion and barely qualified as planets,\nastrophysicists had never found a single \u201cexosolar planet,\u201d a world orbiting a star other than the Sun.\nAt the end of that year came the dramatic announcement of the first such discovery; then, a few months\nlater, came four more; and then, with the floodgates open, finding new worlds proceeded ever more\nswiftly. Today, we know of far more exosolar planets around other stars than of the now familiar\nworlds that orbit the Sun\u2014a tally that exceeds 100 and is almost certain to keep growing for years to\ncome.\nTo describe these newfound worlds, and analyze the implications of their existence in the search for\nextraterrestrial life, we must confront a single hard-to-believe fact: Although astrophysicists assert\nthat they not only know that these planets exist but have also deduced their masses, their distances\nfrom their parent stars, the times that the planets take to complete their orbits, and even the shapes of\nthose orbits, no one has ever seen or photographed a single one of these exosolar planets.\nHow can anybody deduce so much about planets they have never seen? The answer lies in detective\nwork familiar to those who study starlight. By separating that light into its spectrum of colors, and by\ncomparing those spectra among thousands of stars, those who specialize in observing starlight can\nrecognize different types of stars purely by the ratios of the intensities of the different colors that\nappear in stellar spectra. Once upon a time, these astrophysicists photographed the stars\u2019 spectra, but\ntoday they use sensitive devices that register digitally how much starlight of each particular color\nreaches us on Earth. Though the stars are many trillions of miles from us, their fundamental natures\nhave become an open book. Astrophysicists can now easily determine\u2014purely by measuring the\nspectrum of the colors of starlight\u2014which stars most closely resemble the Sun, which are somewhat\nhotter and more luminous, and which are cooler and intrinsically fainter than our star.\nBut they can also do more. Having grown familiar with the distribution of colors in the spectra of\nvarious types of stars, astrophysicists can quickly identify a familiar pattern in the star\u2019s spectrum,\nwhich typically shows the partial or total absence of light at particular colors. They often recognize\nsuch a pattern, but find that all the colors that form it have been slightly shifted toward either the red\nor the violet end of the spectrum, so that all the familiar guideposts are now either somewhat redder\nor somewhat more violet than the norm.\nScientists characterize these colors by their wavelengths, which measure the separation between\nsuccessive wave crests in the vibrating light waves.

When astrophysicists spot a familiar pattern in the intensity of light measured for\nthousands of different colors, but find that all the wavelengths in the pattern are (for example) 1\npercent longer than usual, they conclude that the star\u2019s colors have changed as the result of the\nDoppler effect, which describes what happens when we observe an object either approaching us or\nreceding from us. If, for example, an object moves toward us, or we move toward it, we find that all\nthe wavelengths of the light that we detect are \nshorter\n than those we measure from an identical object\nat rest with respect to ourselves. If the object recedes from us, or we recede from it, we find all the\nwavelengths to be \nlonger\n than those from an object at rest. The deviation from the at-rest situation\ndepends on the relative velocity between the light source and those who observe it. For speeds much\nless than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second), the fractional change in all the wavelengths of\nlight, called the Doppler shift, equals the ratio of the speed of approach or recession to the speed of\nlight.\nDuring the 1990s, two teams of astronomers, one in the United States and one centered in\nSwitzerland, devoted themselves to increasing the precision with which they could measure the\nDoppler shifts of starlight. They did so not simply because scientists always prefer to make more\naccurate measurements, but because they had a straightforward goal: to detect the existence of \nplanets\nby studying the light from \nstars\n.\nWhy this roundabout approach to the detection of exosolar planets? Because for now this method\noffers the only effective way to discover them. If our solar system offers any guide to the distances at\nwhich planets orbit stars, we must conclude that these distances amount to only a tiny fraction of the\ndistances between stars. The Sun\u2019s closest neighbor stars are about half a million times farther from\nus than the distance between the Sun and its innermost planet, Mercury. Even Pluto\u2019s distance from the\nSun is less than one five-thousandth of the distance to Alpha Centauri, our closest star system. These\nastronomically minuscule separations between the stars and their planets, combined with the faintness\nwith which a planet reflects light from its star, make it nearly impossible for us to actually see any\nplanets beyond the solar system. Imagine, for example, an astrophysicist on a planet around one of the\nAlpha Centauri stars who turns her telescope toward the Sun and attempts to spot Jupiter, the Sun\u2019s\nlargest planet. The Sun-Jupiter distance amounts to only one fifty-thousandth of the distance to the\nSun, and Jupiter shines with just one billionth of the Sun\u2019s intensity. Astrophysicists like to compare\nthis to the problem of seeing a firefly next to a searchlight\u2019s glare. We may do it some day, but for\nnow the quest to observe exosolar planets directly lies beyond our technological capabilities.\nThe Doppler effect offers another approach. If we study the star closely, we can carefully measure\nany changes that appear in the Doppler shift of the light from that star. These changes must arise from\nchanges in the speed with which the star is either approaching us or receding from us. If the changes\nprove to be cyclical\u2014that is, if their amounts rise to a maximum, fall to a minimum, rise to the same\nmaximum again, and repeat this cycle over the same intervals of time\u2014then the entirely reasonable\nconclusion follows that the star must be moving in an orbit that takes it around and around some point\nin space.\nWhat could make a star dance like that?

When they pull on a nearby star that possesses far\nmore mass than they do, they produce only small changes in the star\u2019s velocity. Jupiter, for example,\nchanges the Sun\u2019s velocity by about 40 feet per second, slightly more than the speed of a world-class\nsprinter. As Jupiter performs its twelve-year orbit around the Sun, an observer located along the\nplane of this orbit would measure Doppler shifts in the Sun\u2019s light. These Doppler shifts would\ndemonstrate that at a particular time, the Sun\u2019s velocity with respect to the observer would rise 40\nfeet per second above its average value. Six years later, the same observer would find that the Sun\u2019s\nvelocity is 40 feet per second less than average. During the interim, this relative velocity would shift\nsmoothly between its two extreme values. After a few decades of observing this repetitive cycle, the\nobserver would justifiably conclude that the Sun has a planet moving in a twelve-year orbit that\ncauses the Sun to perform its own orbit, producing the velocity changes that arise naturally from this\nmotion. The size of the Sun\u2019s orbit, in comparison to the size of Jupiter\u2019s, exactly equals the \ninverse\nof the ratio of the two objects\u2019 masses.

The Sun\u2019s net motion therefore amounts to a superposition of orbital dances, each\nwith a different cyclical period of repetition. Because Jupiter, the Sun\u2019s largest and most massive\nplanet, exerts the greatest amount of gravitational force on the Sun, the dance imposed by Jupiter\ndominates this complex pattern.\nWhen astrophysicists sought to detect exosolar planets by watching stars dance, they knew that to\nfind a planet roughly similar to Jupiter, orbiting its star at a distance comparable to Jupiter\u2019s distance\nfrom the Sun, they would have to measure Doppler shifts with an accuracy sufficient to reveal\nvelocity changes of approximately 40 feet per second. On Earth this sounds like a significant speed\n(about 27 miles per hour), but in astronomical terms, we are talking about less than one millionth of\nthe speed of light, and about one thousandth of the typical speed with which stars happen to be\nmoving toward us or away from us. Thus to detect the Doppler shift produced by a change in velocity\nequal to one millionth of the speed of light, astrophysicists must measure changes in wavelength\u2014that\nis, in star colors\u2014of one part in a million.\nThese precision measurements\n yielded more than the detection of planets. First of all, because the\ndetection scheme lies in finding a cyclical repetition in the changes of a star\u2019s velocity, the length of\neach of these cycles directly measures the orbital period of the planet responsible for it. If the star\ndances with a particular cycle of repetition, the planet likewise must be dancing with an identical\nperiod of motion, though in a much larger orbit. This orbital period in turn reveals the distance of the\nplanet from the star. Isaac Newton long ago proved that an object orbiting a star will complete each\norbit more rapidly when closer to the star, more slowly when farther away: each orbital period\ncorresponds to a particular value of the average distance between the star and the orbiting object. In\nthe solar system, for instance, a one-year orbital period implies a distance equal to the Earth-Sun\ndistance, whereas a twelve-year period implies a distance 5.2 times larger, the size of Jupiter\u2019s orbit.\nSo the research team could announce not only that they had found a planet but also that they knew both", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3895, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95e9722a-fced-4637-ba48-532ec9a12acc": {"__data__": {"id_": "95e9722a-fced-4637-ba48-532ec9a12acc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "182a91c2-9b0e-42e3-80e1-e33229ae8470", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "e2a84ae22235bb179bd2754de4fad85a54155a5d8ede6843091ddf6fe35869df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "the planet\u2019s orbital period and its average distance from its star.\nThey could deduce still more about the planet.

More massive\nplanets exert greater force, and these forces make the star dance more rapidly. Once they knew the\nplanet-star distances, the team could then include the \nmasses\n of the planets in the list of planetary\ncharacteristics that they had determined through careful observation and deduction.\nThis deduction of a planet\u2019s mass by observing the star\u2019s dance comes with a disclaimer.\nAstronomers have no way to tell whether they are studying a dancing star from a direction that\nhappens to coincide exactly with the plane of the planet\u2019s orbit, or from a direction directly above the\nplane of the orbit (in which case they will measure a zero velocity for the star), or (in almost all\ncases) from a direction neither exactly along the plane nor directly perpendicular to it. The plane of\nthe planet\u2019s orbit around the star coincides with the plane of the star\u2019s motion in response to the\nplanet\u2019s gravity. We therefore observe the full orbital speeds only if our line of sight to the star\nhappens to be the same as the plane of the planet\u2019s orbit around the star. To imagine a loosely\nanalogous situation, put yourself at a baseball game, able to measure the speed of the pitched ball as\nit comes toward you or moves away, but not the speed with which the ball crosses your field of\nvision. If you are a talent scout, the best place for you to sit is behind home plate, in direct line with\nthe baseball\u2019s motion. But if you observe the game from the first or third baselines, the ball thrown by\nthe pitcher will, for the most part, neither approach you nor recede from you, so your measurement of\nthe ball\u2019s speed along your line of sight will be nearly zero.\nBecause the Doppler effect reveals only the speed with which a star moves toward us or away from\nus, but not how rapidly the star crosses our line of sight, we usually cannot tell how nearly our line of\nsight to the star lies in the plane of the star\u2019s orbit. This fact implies that the masses that we deduce\nfor exosolar planets are all \nminimum\n masses; they will prove to be the planets\u2019 actual masses only in\nthose cases when we do observe the star along its orbital plane. On the average, the actual mass of an\nexosolar planet equals twice the minimum mass deduced from observing the star\u2019s motions, but we\nhave no way to know which exosolar planet masses lie above this average ratio, and which below.\nIn addition to deducing the planet\u2019s orbital period and orbital size, as well as the planet\u2019s minimum\nmass, astrophysicists who study star dances by the Doppler effect have one more success: they can\ndetermine the shape of the planet\u2019s orbit. Some of these orbits, like those of Venus and Neptune\naround the Sun, have an almost perfect circularity; but others, like the orbits of Mercury, Mars, and\nPluto, have significant elongation, with the planet traveling much closer to the Sun at some points\nalong its orbit than at others. Because a planet moves more rapidly when it is closer to its star, the\nstar changes its velocity more rapidly at those times. If astronomers observe a star that changes its\nvelocity at a constant rate throughout its cyclical period, they conclude that these changes arise from a\nplanet moving in a circular orbit. If, on the other hand, they find that the changes sometimes occur\nmore rapidly and sometimes more slowly, they deduce that the planet has a noncircular orbit, and can\nfind the amount of the orbital elongation\u2014the amount by which the orbit deviates from circularity\u2014\nby measuring the different rates at which the star changes its velocity throughout the orbital cycle.\nThus, in a triumph of accurate observations coupled with their powers of deduction, astrophysicists\nwho study exosolar planets can provide four key properties of any planet that they find: the planet\u2019s", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4038, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e377c48f-5af3-418a-b4cc-dce892dd64a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e377c48f-5af3-418a-b4cc-dce892dd64a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27e85bdf-509c-42cb-b8ae-d0b1a3ec0823", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "6186cb852ae4bfaffe851d71af81d2ef9094af286c4add129cf0e271ad782cdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "orbital period; its average distance from its star; its minimum mass; and its orbital elongation.\nAstrophysicists achieve all this by capturing the colors of light from stars that lie hundreds of trillions\nof miles from the solar system, and by measuring those changes with a precision better than one part\nin a million\u2014a high point in our attempts to probe the heavens in a search for Earth\u2019s cousins.\nOnly one problem remains. Many of the exosolar planets discovered during the past decade orbit\ntheir stars at distances much smaller than any of the distances between the Sun to its planets. This\nissue looms larger because all the exosolar planets so far detected have masses comparable to that of\nJupiter, a giant planet that orbits the Sun at more than five times the Earth-Sun distance. Let us take a\nmoment to examine the facts, before we admire the astrophysicists\u2019 explanations of how these planets\nmay have come to occupy orbits so much smaller than those familiar to us in our own planetary\nsystem.\nWhenever we use the star dance method to search for planets around other stars, we must remain\naware of the biases built into this method. First, planets close to their stars take much less time to\norbit than do planets far from their stars. Since astrophysicists have limited amounts of time with\nwhich to observe the universe, they will naturally discover planets moving in, for example, six-month\nperiods far more quickly than they can detect planets that take a dozen years for each orbit. In both\ncases, the astrophysicists must wait through at least a couple of orbits to be certain that they have\ndetected a repeatable pattern of the changes in the stars\u2019 velocities. To find planets with orbital\nperiods comparable to Jupiter\u2019s twelve years could therefore consume much of an individual\u2019s\nprofessional career.\nSecond, a planet will exert more gravitational force on its host star when close rather than when far.\nThese greater forces make the star dance more rapidly, producing larger Doppler shifts in their\nspectra. Since we can detect larger shifts more easily than smaller ones, the closer-in planets attract\nmore attention, and do so more rapidly, than the farther-out planets do. At all distances, however, an\nexosolar planet must have a mass roughly comparable to Jupiter\u2019s (318 times Earth\u2019s) to be detected\nby the Doppler shift method. Planets with significantly less mass cannot make their stars dance with a\nspeed that rises above the threshold of detectability by today\u2019s technology.\nIn hindsight, then, no surprise should have accompanied the news that the first exosolar planets to be\ndiscovered all have masses comparable to Jupiter\u2019s, and all orbit close to their stars. The surprise\nlay in just how close many of these planets turned out to be\u2014so close that they take not several\nmonths or years to complete each orbit, as the Sun\u2019s planets do, but only a few days. Astrophysicists\nhave now found more than a dozen planets that complete each orbit in less than a week, with the\nrecord holder sweeping out each orbit in just over two and a half days. This planet, which orbits the\nSun-like star known as HD73256, has a mass at least 1.9 times Jupiter\u2019s mass, and moves in a slightly\nelongated orbit at an average distance from its star equal to only 3.7 percent of the Earth-Sun\ndistance. In other words, this giant planet possesses more than 600 times Earth\u2019s mass at a distance\nfrom its star less than one tenth that of Mercury.\nMercury consists of rock and metal, baked to temperatures of many hundred degrees on the side that\nhappens to face the Sun. In contrast, Jupiter and the Sun\u2019s other giant planets (Saturn, Uranus, and\nNeptune) are enormous balls of gas, surrounding solid cores that include only a few percent of each\nplanet\u2019s mass.

The conclusion follows, as one more step in the great detective story that has\ngiven us exosolar planets, that all exosolar planets so far discovered (since they have masses\ncomparable to Jupiter\u2019s), must likewise be great balls of gas.\nTwo questions immediately arise from this startling conclusion: How did these Jupiter-like planets\never come to orbit so close to their stars, and why doesn\u2019t their gas quickly evaporate under the\nintense heat? The second question has a relatively easy answer: The planets\u2019 enormous masses can\nretain even light gases heated to temperatures of hundreds of degrees, simply because the planets\u2019\ngravitational forces can overcome the tendency of the atoms and molecules in the gas to escape into\nspace. In the most extreme cases, however, this contest tips only narrowly in favor of gravity, and the\nplanets lie just outside the distance at which their stars\u2019 heat would indeed evaporate their gases.\nThe first question, of how giant planets came to orbit so close to Sun-like stars, brings us to the\nfundamental issue of how planets formed. As we have seen in Chapter 11, theorists have worked hard\nto achieve some understanding of the planet-formation process in our solar system. They conclude\nthat the Sun\u2019s planets accumulated themselves into being, growing from smaller clumps of matter into\nlarger ones within a pancake-shaped cloud of gas and dust. Within this flattened, rotating mass of\nmatter that surrounded the Sun, individual concentrations of matter formed, first at random, but then,\nbecause they had a density greater than average, by winning the gravitational tug-of-war among\nparticles. In the final stages of this process, Earth and the other solid planets survived an intense\nbombardment from the last of the giant chunks of material.\nAs this agglutinative process unfolded, the Sun began to shine, evaporating the lightest elements,\nsuch as hydrogen and helium, from its immediate neighborhood, and leaving its four inner planets\n(Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) composed almost entirely of heavier elements such as carbon,\noxygen, silicon, aluminum, and iron. In contrast, each of the clumps of matter that formed at five to\nthirty times Earth\u2019s distance from the Sun remained sufficiently cool to retain much of the hydrogen\nand helium in its vicinity. Because these two lightest elements are also the most abundant, this\nretentive ability produced four giant planets, each with many times Earth\u2019s mass.\nPluto belongs neither to the class of rocky, inner planets nor to the group of outer gas-giant planets.\nInstead, Pluto, still uninspected by spacecraft from Earth, resembles a giant comet, made of a mixture\nof rock and ice. Comets, which typically have diameters of 5 to 50 miles rather than Pluto\u2019s 2,000\nmiles, rank among the first sizable clumps of matter to form within the early solar system; they are\nrivaled in age by the oldest meteorites, which are fragments of rock, metal, or rock-and-metal\nmixtures that happen to have struck Earth\u2019s surface and to have been recognized by those who know\nhow to tell a meteorite from a garden-variety rock.\nThus the planets built themselves from matter much like that in comets and meteorites, with the giant\nplanets using their solid cores to attract and retain a much larger amount of gas. Radioactive dating of\nthe minerals in meteorites have shown that the oldest of them have ages of 4.55 billion years,\nsignificantly greater than the oldest rocks found on the Moon (4.2 billion years) or on Earth (just less\nthan 4 billion years).

Indeed,\nbecause the first exosolar planets to be discovered all had such small distances from their stars, for a\ntime it appeared as though our solar system might prove the exception, rather than the model of\nplanetary systems, as theorists had implicitly assumed in the days when they had nothing else on\nwhich to base their conclusions. Understanding the bias imposed by the relative ease of discovering\nclose-in planets gave them some reassurance, and before long they had observed for sufficiently long\ntimes, and with sufficient accuracy, to detect gas-giant planets at much greater distances from their\nstars.\nToday, the list of exosolar planets, ordered by distance from the star to the planet, begins with the\nentry described above, of a planet that takes only 2.5 days to perform each orbit, and extends, through\nwell over a hundred entries, to the star 55 Cancri, where a planet with at least four times the mass of\nJupiter takes 13.7 years for each orbit. Astrophysicists can calculate from the orbital period that this\nplanet has a distance from its star equal to 5.9 times the Sun-Earth distance, or 1.14 times the distance\nfrom the Sun to Jupiter. The planet ranks as the first to be found with a distance from its star greater\nthan the Sun-Jupiter distance, and therefore seems to provide a planetary system roughly comparable\nto our solar system, at least so far as the star and its largest planet are concerned.\nHowever, this is not quite so. The planet that orbits 55 Cancri at 5.9 times the Earth-Sun distance\nrepresents not the first but the \nthird\n to be discovered in orbit around this star. By now, astronomers\nhave accumulated sufficient data, and have grown so skilled at interpreting their Doppler shift\nobservations, that they can disentangle the complex star dance produced by two or more planets. Each\nof these planets attempts to impose a dance in its own rhythm, with a repetitive period equal to the\nspan of the planet\u2019s orbit around the star. By observing for a sufficiently long time, and by employing\ncomputer programs that fear no calculation, planet hunters can tease from comingled dances the basic\nsteps induced by each orbiting world. In the case of 55 Cancri, a modest star visible in the\nconstellation called the Crab, they had already found two closer-in planets, with orbital periods of 42\ndays and 89 days and minimum masses of 0.84 and 0.21 Jupiter masses, respectively. The planet with\na minimum mass equal to \u201conly\u201d 0.21 Jupiter masses (67 Earth masses) ranks among the least\nmassive yet detected; but the record low mass for an exosolar planet has now fallen to 35 Earth\nmasses\u2014still so many times greater than Earth\u2019s that we should not hold our breath in anticipation\nthat astronomers will soon find Earth\u2019s cousins.\nCircle it as we may, we cannot avoid the problem, evident from the orbits of the planets around 55\nCancri, of explaining why and how many exosolar planets, with masses much like Jupiter\u2019s, orbit\ntheir stars at stunningly small distances.

This conclusion, if valid, raises at least three burning questions:\n1. What made these planets move into smaller orbits after they had formed?\n2. What stopped them from moving all the way into their stars and perishing?\n3. Why did this occur in many other planetary systems, but not in our solar system?\nThese questions have answers, supplied by fertile minds once they had been properly stimulated by\nthe discovery of exosolar planets. We may summarize the scenario now favored by experts as\nfollows:\n1. \u201cPlanetary migration\u201d occurred because significant amounts of material left over from the\nformation process continued to orbit the star within the orbits of the new-formed giant planets. This\nmaterial gets systematically flung by the big planet\u2019s gravity to outer orbits, which in turn forces the\nbig planet to creep inward.\n2. When the planets had approached much closer to their stars than their points of origin, the tidal\nforces from the star locked the planet into place. These forces, comparable to the tidal forces from the\nSun and Moon that raise tides in Earth\u2019s oceans, forced the planets\u2019 rotational periods to equal their\norbital periods, as happened to the Moon from Earth\u2019s tidal forces. They also prevented any further\napproach of the planet to the star, for reasons that require sufficient involvement with celestial\nmechanics to merit passing over here.\n3. Presumably the luck of the draw determined which planetary systems formed with large amounts\nof debris, capable of inducing planetary migration, and which, like our own, had relatively little\ndebris, so the planets remained at the distances at which they had formed. In the case of the planets\naround 55 Cancri, it is possible that all three migrated significantly inward, with the outermost planet\nhaving formed at several times its current distance from the star. Or it may be that the details of how\nmuch debris lived inside the planet\u2019s orbit, and how much outside, caused significant migration of the\ntwo inner planets, while the third has remained in its original path.\nSome work remains to be done, to put things politely, before astrophysicists can proclaim they have\nexplained how planetary systems form around stars. Meanwhile, those who hunt for exosolar planets\ncontinue to pursue their dream of finding Earth\u2019s twin, a planet similar to Earth in its size, mass, and\norbital distance from its parent star. When and if they find such a planet, they hope to examine it\u2014\neven from a distance of dozens of light-years\u2014with sufficient precision to determine whether the\nplanet possesses an atmosphere and oceans similar to Earth\u2019s, and perhaps whether life exists upon\nthat planet like our own.\nIn pursuit of this dream, astrophysicists know that they need instruments orbiting above our\natmosphere, whose blurring effects prevent us from making extremely precise measurements. One\nexperiment, NASA\u2019s \nKepler\n mission, aims at observing hundreds of thousands of nearby stars,\nseeking the tiny diminution in starlight (about one hundredth of 1 percent) caused by the motion of an\nEarthsized planet across our line of sight to a star. This approach can succeed only for the small\nfraction of situations in which our view lies almost exactly along the planet\u2019s orbital plane, but for\nthose cases, the interval between planetary transits equals the planet\u2019s orbital period, which in turn\nspecifies the planet-star distance, and the amount of starlight diminution reveals the size of the planet.\nHowever, if we hope to find out more than the planet\u2019s bare physical characteristics, we must study", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3593, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fbe0068-1380-40e6-b79b-67345a9ee3f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fbe0068-1380-40e6-b79b-67345a9ee3f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2cad7f9a-ab7f-45f9-a11b-f0f9919c3fa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "ea73e247aad442480e9b8e605b48edd26d94e88dd019b5c3ad4132ee14b48a4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "the planet by direct imaging and analysis of the spectrum of the light that the planet reflects into space.\nNASA and ESA, the European Space Agency, have programs under way to achieve this goal within\ntwo decades.

For centuries, humans have wondered how we might find other intelligent beings in the\ncosmos, and with whom we might enjoy at least a modest conversation before we pass into history.\nThe crucial clues for resolving this puzzle may appear in the cosmic blueprint of our own beginnings,\nwhich includes Earth\u2019s origin within the Sun\u2019s family of planets, the origin of the stars that provide\nenergy for life, the origin of structure in the universe, and the origin and evolution of the universe\nitself.\nIf we could only read this blueprint in detail, it could direct us from the largest to the smallest\nastronomical situations, from the unbounded cosmos to individual locations where different types of\nlife flourish and evolve. If we could compare the diverse forms of life that arose under various\ncircumstances, we could perceive the rules of life\u2019s beginnings, both in general terms and in\nparticular cosmic situations. Today, we know of only one form of life: life on Earth, all of which\nshares a common origin and uses DNA molecules as the fundamental means of reproducing itself.\nThis fact deprives us of multiple examples of life, relegating to the future a general survey of life in\nthe cosmos, unachievable until the day we begin to discover forms of life beyond our planet.\nThings could be worse. We do know a great deal about life\u2019s history on our planet, and must build\non this knowledge to derive basic principles about life throughout the universe. To the extent that we\ncan rely on these principles, they will tell us when and where the universe provides, or has provided,\nthe basic requirements for life. In all our attempts to imagine life elsewhere, we must resist falling\ninto the trap of anthropomorphic thinking, our natural tendency to imagine that extraterrestrial forms of\nlife must be much like our own.

The most\nrecent information that bears upon the chances for life beyond Earth\u2014the discovery that planets are\nmoving in orbit around many of the Sun\u2019s neighboring stars\u2014points toward the optimistic conclusion\nthat life may prove relatively abundant in the Milky Way. Nevertheless, great issues remain to be\nresolved before this conclusion can gain a firmer footing. If, for example, planets are indeed\nabundant, but almost none of these planets provide the proper conditions for life, then the pessimistic\nview of extraterrestrial life seems likely to prove correct.\nScientists who contemplate\n the possibilities of extraterrestrial life often invoke the Drake equation, after\nFrank Drake, the American astronomer who created it during the early 1960s. The Drake equation\nprovides a useful concept rather than a rigorous statement of how the physical universe works. The\nequation usefully organizes our knowledge and ignorance by separating the number that we dearly\nseek to estimate\u2014the number of places where intelligent life now exists in our galaxy\u2014into a set of\nterms, each of which describes a necessary condition for intelligent life. These terms include (1) the\nnumber of stars in the Milky Way that survive sufficiently long for intelligent life to evolve on planets\naround them; (2) the average number of planets around each of these stars; (3) the fraction of these\nplanets with conditions suitable for life; (4) the probability that life actually arises on these suitable\nplanets; and (5) the chance that life on such a planet evolves to produce an intelligent civilization, by\nwhich astronomers typically mean a form of life capable of communicating with ourselves. When we\nmultiply these five terms, we obtain the number of planets in the Milky Way that possess an intelligent\ncivilization at some point in their history. To make the Drake equation yield the number that we seek\n\u2014the number of intelligent civilizations that exist at any representative time, such as the present\u2014we\nmust multiply this product by a sixth and final term, the ratio of the average lifetime of an intelligent\ncivilization to the total lifetime of the Milky Way galaxy (about 10 billion years).\nEach of the Drake equation\u2019s six terms requires astronomical, biological, or sociological\nknowledge. We now have good estimates of the equation\u2019s first two terms, and seem likely to obtain a\nuseful estimate of the third before long. On the other hand, terms four and five\u2014the probability that\nlife arises on a suitable planet, and the probability that this life evolves to produce an intelligent\ncivilization\u2014require that we discover and examine various forms of life throughout the galaxy. For\nnow, anyone can argue almost as well as experts can about the value of these terms. What is the\nprobability, for example, that if a planet does have conditions suitable for life, then life will actually\nbegin on that planet? A scientific approach to this question cries out for the study of several planets\nsuitable for life for a few billion years to see how many do produce life.

Astrobiologists will\ntell you honestly that this question has no simple or generally accepted answer. Not much use to say\nthat we\u2019ll know it when we see it. No matter what characteristic we specify to separate living from\nnonliving matter on Earth, we can always find an example that blurs or erases this distinction. Some\nor all living creatures grow, move, or decay, but so too do objects that we would never call alive.\nDoes life reproduce itself? So does fire. Does life evolve to produce new forms? So do certain\ncrystals that grow in watery solutions. We can certainly say that you can tell some forms of life when\nyou see them\u2014who could fail to see life in a salmon or an eagle?\u2014but anyone familiar with life in its\ndiverse forms on Earth will admit that many creatures will remain entirely undetected until the luck of\ntime and the skill of an expert reveal their living nature.\nSince life is short, we must press onward with a rough-and-ready, generally appropriate criterion\nfor life. Here it is: Life consists of sets of objects that can both reproduce and evolve. We shall not\ncall a group of objects alive simply because they make more of themselves. To qualify as life, they\nmust also evolve into new forms as time passes. This definition therefore eliminates the possibility\nthat any single object can be judged to be alive. Instead, we must examine a range of objects in space\nand follow them through time. This definition of life may yet prove too restrictive, but for now we\nshall employ it.\nAs biologists have examined the different types of life on our planet, they have discovered a general\nproperty of Earthlife. The matter within every living Earth creature mainly consists of just four\nchemical elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. All the other elements together contribute\nless than one percent of the mass of any living organism. The elements beyond the big four include\nsmall amounts of phosphorus, which ranks as the most important, and is essential to most forms of\nlife, together with still smaller amounts of sulfur, sodium, magnesium, chlorine, potassium, calcium,\nand iron.\nBut can we conclude that this elemental property of life on Earth must likewise describe other forms\nof life in the cosmos? Here we can apply the Copernican principle in full vigor. The four elements\nthat form the bulk of life on Earth all appear on the short list of the universe\u2019s six most abundant\nelements. Since the other two elements on that list, helium and neon, almost never combine with\nanything else, life on Earth consists of the most abundant and chemically active ingredients in the\ncosmos. Of all the predictions that we can make about life on other worlds, the surest seems to be that\ntheir life will be made of elements nearly the same as those used by life on Earth. If life on our planet\nconsisted primarily of four extremely rare elements in the cosmos, such as niobium, bismuth, gallium,\nand plutonium, we would have an excellent reason to suspect that we represent something special in\nthe universe.

If we lived on a planet made primarily of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, then the\nfact that life consists primarily of these four elements would hardly surprise us. But Earth is mainly\nmade of oxygen, iron, silicon, and magnesium, and its outermost layers are mostly oxygen, silicon,\naluminum, and iron. Only one of these elements, oxygen, appears on the list of life\u2019s most abundant\nelements. When we look into Earth\u2019s oceans, which are almost entirely hydrogen and oxygen, it is\nsurprising that life lists carbon and nitrogen among its most abundant elements, rather than chlorine,\nsodium, sulfur, calcium, or potassium, which are the most common elements dissolved in seawater.\nThe distribution of the elements in life on Earth resembles the composition of the stars far more than\nthat of Earth itself. As a result, life\u2019s elements are more cosmically abundant than Earth\u2019s\u2014a good\nstart for those who hope to find life in a host of situations.\nOnce we have established that the raw materials for life are abundant throughout the cosmos, we\nmay proceed to ask: How often do these raw materials, along with a site on which these materials can\ncollect and a convenient source of energy such as a nearby star, lead to the existence of life itself?\nSomeday, when we have made a good survey of possible sites for life in our Sun\u2019s neighborhood, we\nshall have a statistically accurate answer to this question. In the absence of these data, we must take a\nroundabout path to an answer and ask, How did life begin on Earth?\nThe origin of\n life on Earth remains locked in murky uncertainty. Our ignorance about life\u2019s beginnings\nstems in large part from the fact that whatever events made inanimate matter come alive occurred\nbillions of years ago and left no definitive traces behind. For times more than 4 billion years in the\npast, the fossil and geological record of Earth\u2019s history does not exist. Yet the interval in solar system\nhistory between 4.6 and 4 billion years ago\u2014the first 600 million years after the Sun and its planets\nhad formed\u2014includes the era when most paleobiologists, specialists in reconstructing life that\nexisted during long-vanished epochs, believe that life first appeared on our planet.\nThe absence of all geological evidence from epochs more than 4 billion years ago arises from\nmotions of Earth\u2019s crust, familiarly called continental drift but scientifically known as plate tectonics.\nThese motions, driven by heat that wells up from Earth\u2019s interior, continually force pieces of our\nplanet\u2019s crust to slide, collide, and ride by or over one another. Plate tectonic motions have slowly\nburied everything that once lay on Earth\u2019s surface. As a result, we possess few rocks older than 2\nbillion years, and none more than 3.8 billion years in age. This fact, together with the reasonable\nconclusion that the most primitive forms of life had little chance of leaving behind fossil evidence,\nhas left our planet devoid of any reliable record of life during Earth\u2019s first 1 or 2 billion years. The\noldest definite evidence we have for life on Earth takes us back \u201conly\u201d 2.7 billion years into the past,\nwith indirect indications that life did exist more than 1 billion years before then.\nMost paleobiologists believe that life must have appeared on Earth at least 3 billion years ago, and\nquite possibly more than 4 billion years ago, within the first 600 million years after Earth formed.\nTheir conclusion relies on a reasonable supposition about primitive organisms.

As a result, oxygen\u2019s appearance in Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nmeant that all forms of life had to adapt or die\u2014and that if life had not appeared by that time, it could\nnever do so thereafter, because the would-be organisms would have nothing to eat, for their potential\nfood would have rusted away.

There too, atmospheric oxygen\nwould prevent life from originating by combining with all possible nutrients that could sustain life.\nOxygen kills! Not what we usually say about this eighth element on the periodic table, but for life\nthroughout the cosmos, this verdict appears accurate: Life must begin early in a planet\u2019s history, or\nelse the appearance of oxygen in its atmosphere will put the kibosh on life forever.\nBy a strange\n coincidence, the epoch missing from the geological record that includes the origin of life\nalso includes the so-called era of bombardment, which covers those critical first few hundred million\nyears after Earth had formed. All portions of Earth\u2019s surface must then have endured a continual rain\nof objects. During those several hundred thousand millennia, infalling objects as large as the one that\nmade the Meteor Crater in Arizona must have struck our planet several times in every century, with\nmuch larger objects, each several miles in diameter, colliding with Earth every few thousand years.\nEach one of the large impacts would have caused a local remodeling of the surface, so a hundred\nthousand impacts would have produced global changes in our planet\u2019s topography.\nHow did these impacts affect the origin of life? Biologists tell us that they might have triggered both\nthe appearance and the extinction of life on Earth, not once but many times. Much of the infalling\nmaterial during the era of bombardment consisted of comets, which are essentially large snowballs\nladen with tiny rocks and dirt. Their cometary \u201csnow\u201d consists of both frozen water and frozen\ncarbon dioxide, familiarly called dry ice. In addition to their snow, grit, and rocks rich in minerals\nand metals, the comets that bombarded Earth during its first few hundred million years contained\nmany different types of small molecules, such as methane, ammonia, methyl alcohol, hydrogen\ncyanide, and formaldehyde.

But whether or not life arrived with the comets, the largest\nobjects to strike during the era of bombardment might well have destroyed life that had arisen on\nEarth. Life might have begun, at least in its most primitive forms, in fits and starts many times over,\nwith each new set of organisms surviving for hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, until a\ncollision with a particularly large object wreaked such havoc on Earth that all life perished, only to\nappear again, and to be destroyed again, after the passage of a similar amount of time.\nWe can gain some confidence in the fits-and-starts origin of life from two well-established facts.\nFirst, life appeared on our planet sooner rather than later, during the first third of Earth\u2019s lifetime. If\nlife could and did arise within a billion years, perhaps it could do so in far less time. The origin of\nlife might require no more than a few million, or a few tens of millions, of years. Second, we know\nthat collisions between large objects and Earth have, at intervals of time measured in tens of millions\nof years, destroyed most of the species alive on our planet. The most famous of these, the Cretaceous-\nTertiary extinction 65 million years ago, killed all the non-avian dinosaurs, along with enormous\nnumbers of other species. Even this mass extinction fell short of the most extensive one, the Permian-\nTriassic mass extinction, that destroyed nearly 90 percent of all species of marine life and 70 percent\nof all terrestrial vertebrate species, 252 million years ago, leaving fungi as the dominant forms of life\non land.\nThe Cretaceous-Tertiary and Permian-Triassic mass extinctions arose from the collisions of Earth\nwith objects one or two dozen miles across. Geologists have found an enormous 65-million-year-old\nimpact crater, coincident in time with the Cre-taceous-Tertiary extinction, that stretches across the\nnorthern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the adjoining seabed. A large crater exists with the same age as the\nPermian-Triassic extinction, discovered off the northwest coast of Australia, but this mass dying\nmight have arisen from something in addition to a collision, perhaps from sustained volcanic\neruptions. Even the single example of the Cretaceous-Tertiary dinosaur extinction reminds us of the\nimmense damage to life that the impact of a comet or asteroid can produce. During the era of\nbombardment, Earth must have reeled not only from this sort of impact, but also from the much more\nserious effects of collisions with objects 50, 100, or even 250 miles in diameter. Each of these\ncollisions must have cleared the decks of life, either completely or so thoroughly that only a tiny\npercentage of living organisms managed to survive, and they must have occurred far more often than\ncollisions with ten-mile-wide objects do now. Our present knowledge of astronomy, biology,\nchemistry, and geology points toward an early Earth ready to produce life, and a cosmic environment\nready to eliminate it. And wherever a star and its planets have recently formed, intense bombardment\nby debris left over from the formation process may even now be eliminating all forms of life on those\nplanets.\nMore than 4 billion years ago, most of the debris from the solar system\u2019s formation either collided\nwith a planet or moved into orbits where collisions could not occur.

From Adam\u2019s rib to Dr.\nFrankenstein\u2019s monster, humans have answered the question by invoking a mysterious \n\u00e9lan vital\n that\nimbues otherwise inanimate matter with life.\nScientists seek to probe more deeply, with laboratory experiments and examinations of the fossil\nrecord that attempt to establish the height of the barrier between inanimate and animate matter, and to\nfind how nature breached this dike. Early scientific discussions about the origin of life imagined the\ninteraction of simple molecules, concentrated in pools or tide ponds, to create more complex ones. In\n1871, a dozen years after the publication of Charles Darwin\u2019s marvelous book \nThe Origin of Species\n,\nin which he speculated that \u201cprobably all of the organic beings which have ever lived on this Earth\nhave descended from some one primordial form,\u201d Darwin wrote to his friend Joseph Hooker that\nIt is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present,\nwhich could ever have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some\nwarm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, &c.,\npresent, that a proteine [\nsic\n] compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more\ncomplex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly absorbed, which would not\nhave been the case before living creatures were found.\nIn other words, when Earth was ripe for life, the basic compounds necessary for metabolism might\nhave existed in surplus, with nothing in existence to eat them (and, as we have discussed, no oxygen\nto combine with them and spoil their chances to serve as food).\nFrom a scientific perspective, nothing succeeds like experiments that can be compared with reality.\nIn 1953, seeking to test Darwin\u2019s conception of the origin of life in ponds or tide pools, Stanley\nMiller, who was then a U.S. graduate student working at the University of Chicago with the Nobel\nlaureate Harold Urey, performed a famous experiment that duplicated the conditions within a highly\nsimplified and hypothetical pool of water on the early Earth.

From there the mixture returned to the original flask, completing a cycle that would be\nrepeated over and over during a few days, rather than a few thousand years. After this entirely modest\ntime interval, Miller and Urey found the water in the lower flask to be rich in \u201corganic gunk,\u201d a\ncompound of numerous complex molecules, including different types of sugar, as well as two of the\nsimplest amino acids, alanine and guanine.\nSince protein molecules consist of twenty types of amino acids arranged into different structural\nforms, the Miller-Urey experiment takes us, in a remarkably brief time, a significant part of the way\nfrom the simplest molecules to the amino-acid molecules that form the building blocks of living\norganisms. The Miller-Urey experiment also made some of the modestly complex molecules called\nnucleotides, which provide the key structural element for DNA, the giant molecule that carries\ninstructions for forming new copies of an organism. Even so, a long path remains before life emerges\nfrom experimental laboratories. An enormously significant gap, so far unbridged by human\nexperiment or invention, separates the formation of amino acids\u2014even if our experiments produced\nall twenty of them, which they do not\u2014and the creation of life. Amino-acid molecules have also been\nfound in some of the oldest and least altered meteorites, believed to have remained unchanged for\nnearly the entire 4.6-billion-year history of the solar system. This supports the general conclusion that\nnatural processes can make amino acids in many different situations. A balanced view of the\nexperimental results finds nothing totally surprising: The simpler molecules found in living organisms\nform quickly in many situations, but life does not. The key question still remains: How does a\ncollection of molecules, even one primed for life to appear, ever generate life itself?\nSince the early Earth had not weeks but many million years in which to bring forth life, the Miller-\nUrey experimental results seemed to support the tide-pool model for life\u2019s beginnings. Today,\nhowever, most scientists who seek to explain life\u2019s origin consider the experiment to have been\nsignificantly limited by its techniques. Their shift in attitude arose not from doubting the test\u2019s results,\nbut rather from recognizing a potential flaw in the hypotheses underlying the experiment. To\nunderstand this flaw, we must consider what modern biology has demonstrated about the oldest forms\nof life.\nEvolutionary biology now\n relies on careful study of the similarities and differences between living\ncreatures in their molecules of DNA and RNA, which carry the information that tells an organism how\nto function and how to reproduce. Careful comparison of these relatively enormous and complex\nmolecules has allowed biologists, among whom the great pioneer has been Carl Woese, to create an\nevolutionary tree of life that records the \u201cevolutionary distances\u201d between various life forms, as\ndetermined by the degrees to which these life forms have nonidentical DNA and RNA.\nThe tree of life consists of three great branches, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya, that replace the\nbiological \u201ckingdoms\u201d formerly believed to be fundamental.

Now comes a shocker: Unlike the Bacteria and Eucarya, the Archaea consist\nmainly of \u201cextremophiles,\u201d organisms that love to live, and live to love, in what we now call extreme\nconditions: temperatures near or above the boiling point of water, high acidity, or other situations that\nwould kill other forms of life. (Of course, if the extremophiles had their own biologists, they would\nclassify themselves as normal and any life that thrives at room temperature as an extremophile.)\nModern research into the tree of life tends to suggest that life began with the extremophiles, and only\nlater evolved into forms of life that benefit from what we call normal conditions.\nIn that case, Darwin\u2019s \u201cwarm little pond,\u201d as well as the tide pools duplicated in the Miller-Urey\nexperiment, would evaporate into the mist of rejected hypotheses. Gone would be the relatively mild\ncycles of drying and wetting. Instead, those who seek to find the places where life may have begun\nwould have to look to locales where extremely hot water, possibly laden with acids, surges from\nEarth.\nThe past few decades have allowed oceanographers to discover just such places, along with the\nstrange forms of life they support. In 1977, two oceanographers piloting a deep sea submersible\nvehicle discovered the first deep sea vents, a mile and a half beneath the calm surface of the Pacific\nOcean near the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. At these vents, Earth\u2019s crust behaves locally like a household\ncooker, generating high pressure inside a heavy-duty pot with a lockable lid and heating water beyond\nits ordinary boiling temperature without letting it reach an actual boil. As the lid partially lifts, the\npressurized, superheated water spews out from below Earth\u2019s crust into the cold ocean basins.\nThe superheated seawater that emerges from these vents carries dissolved minerals that quickly\ncollect and solidify to surround the vents with giant, porous rock chimneys, hottest in their cores and\ncoolest at the edges that make direct contact with seawater. Across this temperature gradient live\ncountless life forms that have never seen the Sun and care nothing for solar heating, though they do\nrequire the oxygen dissolved in seawater, which in turn comes from the existence of solar-driven life\nnear the surface. These hardy bugs live on geothermal energy, which combines heat left over from\nEarth\u2019s formation with heat continuously produced by the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes such\nas aluminum-26, which lasts for millions of years, and potassium-40, which lasts for billions.\nNear these vents, far below the depths to which any sunlight can penetrate, the oceanographers\nfound tube worms as long as a man, thriving amidst large colonies of bacteria and other small\ncreatures. Instead of drawing their energy from sunlight, as plants do with photosynthesis, life near\ndeep sea vents relies on \u201cchemosynthesis,\u201d the production of energy by chemical reactions, which in\nturn depend on geothermal heating.\nHow does this chemosynthesis occur? The hot water gushing from the deep sea vents emerges laden\nwith hydrogen-sulfur and hydrogen-iron compounds. Bacteria near the vents combine these molecules\nwith the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water molecules, and with the carbon and oxygen atoms of the\ncarbon dioxide molecules dissolved in sea water. These reactions form larger molecules\u2014\ncarbohydrates\u2014from carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms.

Close by the deep sea vents, other\norganisms consume the carbohydrate-making bacteria, profiting from their energy in the same way that\nanimals eat plants, or eat plant-eating animals.\nIn the chemical reactions near deep sea vents, however, more goes on than the production of\ncarbohydrate molecules. The iron and sulfur atoms, which are not included in the carbohydrate\nmolecule, combine to make compounds of their own, most notably crystals of iron pyrite, familiarly\ncalled \u201cfool\u2019s gold,\u201d known to the ancient Greeks as \u201cfire stone\u201d because a good blow from another\nrock will strike sparks from it. Iron pyrite, the most abundant of all the sulfur-bearing minerals found\non Earth, might have played a crucial role in the origin of life by encouraging the formation of\ncarbohydratelike molecules. This hypothesis sprang from the mind of a German patent attorney and\namateur biologist, G\u00fcnter W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user, whose profession hardly excludes him from biological\nspeculation, any more than Einstein\u2019s work as a patent attorney barred him from insights into physics.\n(To be sure, Einstein had an advanced degree in physics, while W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user\u2019s biology and\nchemistry are mainly self-taught.)\nIn 1994, W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user proposed that the surfaces of iron pyrite crystals, formed naturally by\ncombining iron and sulfur that surged from deep sea vents early in Earth\u2019s history, would have offered\nnatural sites where carbon-rich molecules could accumulate, acquiring new carbon atoms from the\nmaterial ejected by the nearby vents. Like those who hypothesize that life began in ponds or tide\npools, W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user has no clear way to pass from the building blocks to living creatures.\nNevertheless, with his emphasis on the high-temperature origin of life, he may prove to be on the right\ntrack, as he firmly believes. Referring to the highly ordered structure of iron pyrite crystals, on whose\nsurfaces the first complex molecules for life might have formed, W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user has confronted his\ncritics at scientific conferences with the striking statement that \u201cSome say that the origin of life brings\norder out of chaos\u2014but I say, \u2018order out of order out of order!\n\u2019\n\u201d Delivered with German brio, this\nclaim acquires a certain resonance, though only time can tell how accurate it may be.\nSo which basic model for life\u2019s origin is more likely to prove correct\u2014tide pools at the ocean\u2019s\nedge, or superheated vents on the ocean floors? For now, the betting is about even. Experts on the\norigin of life have challenged the assertion that life\u2019s oldest forms lived at high temperatures, because\ncurrent methods for placing organisms at different points along the branches of the tree of life remain\nthe subject of debate. In addition, computer programs that trace out how many compounds of different\ntypes existed in ancient RNA molecules, the close cousins of DNA that apparently preceded DNA in\nlife\u2019s history, suggest that the compounds favored by high temperatures appeared only after life had\nundergone some relatively low-temperature history.\nThus the outcome of our finest research, as so often occurs in science, proves unsettling to those\nwho seek certainty.

For example, Earth\u2019s ocean floors may provide the most stable ecosystem\non our planet. If a jumbo asteroid slammed into Earth and rendered all surface life extinct, the oceanic\nextremophiles would almost certainly continue undaunted in their happy ways. They might even\nevolve to repopulate Earth\u2019s surface after each extinction episode. And if the Sun were mysteriously\nplucked from the center of the solar system and Earth drifted through space, this event would hardly\nmerit attention in the extremophile press, as life near deep sea vents might continue relatively\nundisturbed. But in 5 billion years, the Sun will become a red giant as it expands to fill the inner solar\nsystem. Meanwhile, Earth\u2019s oceans will boil away and Earth itself will partially vaporize. Now that\nwould be news for any form of Earthlife.\nThe ubiquity of extremophiles on Earth leads us to a profound question: Could life exist deep within\nmany of the rogue planets or planetesimals that were ejected from the solar system during its\nformation? Their \u201cgeo\u201dthermal reservoirs could last for billions of years. What about the countless\nplanets that were forcibly ejected by every other solar system that ever formed? Could interstellar\nspace be teeming with life\u2014formed and evolved deep within these starless planets? Before\nastrophysicists recognized the importance of extremophiles, they envisioned a \u201chabitable zone\u201d\nsurrounding each star, within which water or another substance could maintain itself as a liquid,\nallowing molecules to float, interact, and produce more complex molecules. Today, we must modify\nthis concept, so that far from being a tidy region around a star that receives just the right amount of\nsunlight, a habitable zone can be anywhere and everywhere, maintained not by starlight heating but by\nlocalized heat sources, often generated by radioactive rocks.

Purely on numerical grounds, the possibility that life uses atoms such as germanium\nin the same way that Earthlife uses carbon seems highly remote.\nRequirement number (3)\n specifies that all forms of life need a liquid solvent in which molecules can float\nand interact. The word \u201csolvent\u201d emphasizes that a liquid allows this float-and-interact situation, in\nwhat chemists call a \u201csolution.\u201d Liquids allow relatively high concentrations of molecules but do not\nplace tight restrictions on their motions. In contrast, solids lock atoms and molecules in place. They\nactually can collide and interact, but they do so far more slowly than in liquids. In gases, molecules\nwill move even more freely than in liquids, and can collide with even less hindrance, but their\ncollisions and interactions occur far less often than they do in liquids, because the density within a\nliquid typically exceeds that within a gas by a factor of 1,000 or more. \u201cHad we but world enough\nand time,\u201d as Andrew Marvell wrote, we might find life originating in gases rather than liquids. In the\nreal cosmos, only 14 billion years old, astrobiologists do not expect to find life that began in gas.\nInstead, they expect all extraterrestrial life, like all life on Earth, to consist of sacs of liquid, within\nwhich complex chemical processes occur as different types of molecules collide and form new types.\nMust that liquid be water? We live on a watery planet whose oceans cover nearly three quarters of\nthe surface. This makes us unique in our solar system, and possibly a highly unusual planet anywhere\nin our Milky Way galaxy. Water, which consists of molecules made from two of the most abundant\nelements in the cosmos, appears at least in modest amounts in comets, in meteoroids, and in most of\nthe Sun\u2019s planets and their moons.

Could other compounds offer better chances for\nliquid seas or ponds, within which molecules could have found their way to life? The three most\nabundant compounds that can remain liquid within a significant range of temperatures are ammonia,\nethane, and methyl alcohol. Ammonia molecules each consist of three hydrogen atoms and one\nnitrogen atom, ethane of two hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms, and methyl alcohol of four\nhydrogen atoms, one carbon atom, and one oxygen atom. When we consider the possibilities for\nextraterrestrial life, we may reasonably consider creatures that use ammonia, ethane, or methyl\nalcohol in the way that Earth life employs water\u2014as the fundamental liquid within which life\npresumably originated, and which supplies the medium within which molecules can float their way to\nglory. The Sun\u2019s four giant planets possess enormous amounts of ammonia, along with smaller\namounts of methyl alcohol and ethane, and Saturn\u2019s large moon Titan may well have lakes of liquid\nethane on its frigid surface.\nThe choice of a particular type of molecule as life\u2019s basic liquid immediately implies another\nrequirement for life: the substance must remain liquid. We would not expect life to originate in the\nAntarctic ice cap, or in clouds rich in water vapor, because we need liquids to allow abundant\nmolecular interactions. Under atmospheric pressures like those at Earth\u2019s surface, water remains\nliquid between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius (32 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit). All three of the alternative\ntypes of solvents remain liquid within temperature ranges that extend far below water\u2019s. Ammonia,\nfor example, freezes at \n\u2013\n78 degrees Celsius and vaporizes at \n\u2013\n33 degrees. This prevents ammonia\nfrom providing a liquid solvent for life on Earth, but on a world with a temperature 75 degrees colder\nthan ours, where water could never serve as a solvent for life, ammonia might well be the charm.\nWater\u2019s most significant\n distinguishing feature does not consist of its well-earned badge of \u201cuniversal\nsolvent,\u201d about which we learned in chemistry class, nor of the wide temperature range over which\nwater remains liquid. Water\u2019s most remarkable attribute resides in the fact that while most things\u2014\nwater included\u2014shrink and become denser as they cool, water that cools below 4 degrees Celsius\nexpands, becoming progressively less dense as the temperature falls toward zero. And then, when\nwater freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, it turns into an even less dense substance than liquid water. Ice\nfloats, which is very good news for fish. During the winter, as the temperature of the outside air drops\nbelow freezing, 4-degree water sinks to the bottom and stays there, because it is denser than the\ncolder water above, while a floating layer of ice builds extremely slowly on the surface, insulating\nthe warmer water below.\nWithout this density inversion below 4 degrees, ponds and lakes would freeze from the bottom up,\nnot from the top down. Whenever the outside air temperature fell below freezing, a pond\u2019s upper\nsurface would cool and sink to the bottom as warmer water rose from below. This forced convection\nwould rapidly drop the water\u2019s temperature to zero degrees as the surface began to freeze. Then\ndenser, solid ice would sink to the bottom. If the entire body of water did not freeze from the bottom\nupward in a single season, the accumulation of ice at the bottom would allow full freezing to occur\nover the course of many years. In such a world, the sport of ice fishing would yield even fewer results\nthan it does now, because all the fish would be dead\u2014fresh-frozen.

But of all the molecules that can be formed with three atoms, water is by far the most\nabundant, largely because water\u2019s two constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, occupy positions one and\nthree on the abundance list. This suggests that rather than asking why some objects have water, we\nshould ask why they don\u2019t all possess large amounts of this simple molecule.\nHow did Earth acquire its oceans of water? The Moon\u2019s near-pristine record of craters tells us that\nimpacting objects have struck the Moon throughout its history. We may reasonably expect that Earth\nhas likewise undergone many collisions. Indeed, Earth\u2019s larger size and stronger gravity imply that\nwe should have been struck many more times, and by larger objects, than the Moon. So it has been,\nfrom its birth all the way to the present. After all, Earth didn\u2019t hatch from an interstellar void,\nspringing into existence as a preformed spherical blob. Instead, our planet grew within the\ncondensing gas cloud that formed the Sun and its other planets. In this process, Earth grew by\naccreting enormous numbers of small solid particles, and eventually through incessant impacts from\nmineral-rich asteroids and water-rich comets. How incessant? The early impact rate of comets may\nhave been sufficiently large to have brought us the water in all our oceans. Uncertainties (and\ncontroversies) continue to surround this hypothesis. The water that we observed in comet Halley has\nfar greater amounts than Earth does of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen that packs an extra neutron\ninto its nucleus. If Earth\u2019s oceans arrived in comets, then those that hit Earth soon after the solar\nsystem formed must have had a chemical composition notably different from today\u2019s comets, or at\nleast different from the class of comet from which Halley is drawn.\nIn any case, when we add their contribution to the water vapor spewn into the atmosphere by\nvolcanic eruptions, we have no shortage of pathways by which Earth could have acquired its supply", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3786, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c56707e-67d6-4e72-8380-1c48b7a33cbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c56707e-67d6-4e72-8380-1c48b7a33cbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d4383a7-254e-4cb8-b720-8a55f7b1b77f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "a40d42c639d667d199c9ac11770c740a92be69e3b7e8c4a33ce591ae4fb55d56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "of surface water.\nIf you seek\n a waterless, airless place to visit, you need look no farther than Earth\u2019s Moon.

During the two-week lunar night, the\ntemperature can drop to 250 degrees below zero, sufficient to freeze practically anything. The \nApollo\nastronauts who visited the Moon therefore brought all the water and air (and the air conditioning) that\nthey needed for their round-trip journey.\nIt would be odd, however, if Earth had acquired a great deal of water, while the nearby Moon got\nalmost none. One possibility, certainly true at least in part, is that water evaporated from the Moon\u2019s\nsurface much more readily than from Earth\u2019s because of the Moon\u2019s lesser gravity. Another\npossibility suggests that lunar missions may eventually not need to import water or the assortment of\nproducts derived from it. Observations by the \nClementine\n lunar orbiter, which carried an instrument\nto detect the neutrons produced when fast-moving interstellar particles collide with hydrogen atoms,\nsupport a long-held contention that deep-frozen ice deposits may lurk beneath craters near the Moon\u2019s\nnorth and south poles. If the Moon receives an average number of impacts per year from\ninterplanetary flotsam, then the mixture of these impactors should, from time to time, include sizable\nwater-rich comets, like those that strike Earth. How big could these comets be? The solar system\ncontains plenty of comets that could melt into a puddle the size of Lake Erie.\nWhile we can\u2019t expect a freshly laid lake to survive many sun-baked lunar days at temperatures of\n200 degrees, any comet that happened to crash in the bottom of a deep crater near one of the Moon\u2019s\npoles (or happened to make a deep polar crater itself) would remain shrouded in darkness, because\ndeep craters near its poles are the only places on the Moon where the \u201cSun don\u2019t shine.\u201d (If you\nthought that the Moon has a perpetual dark side, you have been badly misled by many sources,\nprobably including Pink Floyd\u2019s 1973 album \nDark Side of the Moon\n.)

Just look at the cubes in your freezer\u2019s ice tray\nupon your return from a long vacation: their sizes will be distinctly smaller than when you departed.\nHowever, if ice has been well mixed with solid particles (as occurs in a comet), it can survive for\nthousands and millions of years at the bottom of the Moon\u2019s deep polar craters. Any outpost that we\nmight establish on the Moon would benefit greatly from being located near this lake. Apart from the\nobvious advantages of having ice to melt, to filter, and then to drink, we could also profit by\ndissociating the water\u2019s hydrogen from its oxygen atoms.

But important questions remain,\nin particular about Venus\u2019 water. If a planetwide flood did occur on Venus, where has all the water\ngone? Did it sink below the surface? Did it evaporate into the atmosphere? Or did the flood consist of\na common substance other than water? Even if no flood occurred, Venus presumably acquired about\nas much water as its sister planet Earth. What has happened to it?\nThe answer seems to be that Venus lost its water by growing too hot, a result attributable to Venus\u2019\natmosphere. Although carbon dioxide molecules let visible light pass by, they trap infrared radiation\nwith great efficiency. Sunlight can therefore penetrate Venus\u2019 atmosphere, even though atmospheric\nreflection reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface. This sunlight heats the planet\u2019s\nsurface, which radiates infrared, and which cannot escape. Instead, the carbon dioxide molecules trap\nit, as the infrared radiation heats the lower atmosphere and the surface below. Scientists call this\ntrapping of infrared radiation the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d by loose analogy to their glass windows, which\nadmit visible light but block some of the infrared. Like Venus and its atmosphere, Earth produces a\ngreenhouse effect, essential for many forms of life, that raises our planet\u2019s temperature by about 25\ndegrees Fahrenheit over what we would find in the absence of an atmosphere. Most of our greenhouse\neffect arises from the combined effects of water and carbon dioxide molecules. Since Earth\u2019s\natmosphere has only one ten-thousandth as many carbon dioxide molecules as the atmosphere of\nVenus does, our greenhouse effect pales in comparison. Nevertheless, we continue to add more\ncarbon dioxide by burning fossil fuels, so we steadily increase the greenhouse effect, performing an\nunintended global experiment to see just what deleterious effects arise from the additional trapping of\nheat. On Venus, the atmospheric greenhouse effect, produced entirely by carbon dioxide molecules,\nraises the temperature by hundreds of degrees, giving Venus\u2019 surface furnacelike temperatures close to\n500\no \nCelsius (900\no\n Fahrenheit)\u2014the hottest in the solar system.\nHow did Venus reach this sorry state? Scientists apply the apt term \u201crunaway greenhouse effect\u201d to\ndescribe what happened as the infrared radiation trapped by Venus\u2019 atmosphere raised the\ntemperatures and encouraged liquid water to evaporate. The additional water in the atmosphere\ntrapped infrared even more effectively, increasing the greenhouse effect; this in turn caused even more\nwater to enter the atmosphere, ratcheting up the greenhouse effect still farther.

Close examination of Venus and Mars, our sister and brother\nplanets, forces us to look at Earth anew and to wonder how fragile our surface supply of liquid water\nmay turn out to be.\nEarly in the twentieth century, imaginative observations of Mars by the noted American astronomer\nPercival Lowell led him to suppose that colonies of resourceful Martians had built an elaborate\nnetwork of canals in order to redistribute water from Mars\u2019 polar ice caps to the more populated\nmiddle latitudes. To explain what he thought he saw, Lowell imagined a dying civilization that was\nexhausting its supply of water, like Phoenix discovering that the Colorado River has its limits. In his\nthorough yet curiously misguided treatise entitled \nMars as the Abode of Life,\n published in 1909,\nLowell lamented the imminent end of the Martian civilization that he imagined he saw.\nIndeed, Mars seems certain to dry up to the point that its surface can support no life at all. Slowly\nbut surely, time will snuff life out, if it has not done so already. When the last living ember dies away,\nthe planet will roll on through space as a dead world, its evolutionary career forever ended.\nLowell happened to get one thing right. If Mars ever had a civilization (or any kind of life at all) that\nrequired water on the surface, it must have faced catastrophe, because at some unknown time in\nMartian history, and for some unknown reason, all the surface water did dry up, leading to the exact\nfate for life\u2014though in the past, not the present\u2014that Lowell described. What happened to the water\nthat flowed abundantly over Mars\u2019 surface billions of years ago remains an outstanding mystery\namong planetary geologists. Mars does have some water ice in its polar caps, which consist mainly of\nfrozen carbon dioxide (\u201cdry ice\u201d), and a tiny amount of water vapor in its atmosphere.

So far as the chance of finding life on Mars is concerned, the great\nquestion to be resolved asks, Does liquid water now exist anywhere on Mars?\nPart of the answer leaps from our knowledge of physics. No liquid water can exist on the Martian\nsurface, because the atmospheric pressure there, less than 1 percent of the value on the surface of\nEarth, does not allow it. As enthusiastic mountaineers know, water vaporizes at progressively lower\ntemperatures as the atmospheric pressure decreases.

On top of\nMount Everest, with air pressure only a quarter of its sea-level value, boiling occurs at about 50\ndegrees. Twenty miles high, where the atmospheric pressure equals only 1 percent of what you feel on\nthe sidewalks of New York, water boils at about 5 degrees Celsius. Rise a few miles higher, and\nliquid water will \u201cboil\u201d at 0 degrees\u2014that is, it will vaporize as soon as you expose it to the air.\nScientists use the word \u201csublimation\u201d to describe the passage of a substance from solid to gas without\nany intervening liquid stage. We all know sublimation from our youth, when the ice cream man\nopened his magic door to reveal not only the delicacies inside but also the chunks of \u201cdry\u201d ice that\nkept them cold. Dry ice offers the ice cream man a great advantage over familiar water ice: It\nsublimates from solid to gas, leaving no messy liquid to clean up. An old detective story conundrum\ndescribes the man who hanged himself by standing on a cake of dry ice until it sublimated, leaving\nhim suspended by a noose, and the detectives without a clue (unless they carefully analyzed the\natmosphere in the room) as to how he did it.\nWhat happens to carbon dioxide on Earth\u2019s surface happens to water on the surface of Mars. No\nchance for liquid exists there, even though the temperature on a warm day of the Martian summer rises\nwell above 0 degrees Celsius. This seems to draw a sad veil over the prospects for life\u2014until we\nrealize that liquid water could exist beneath the surface. Future missions to Mars, intimately bound up\nwith the possibility of finding ancient or even modern life on the red planet, will direct themselves\ntoward regions where they can drill into the Martian surface in a search for the flowing elixir of life.\nElixir though it may appear, water represents a deadly substance among the chemically illiterate, to\nbe avoided sedulously. In 1997, Nathan Zohner, a fourteen-year-old student at Eagle Rock Junior\nHigh School in Idaho, conducted a now famous (among science popularizers) science fair experiment\nto test antitechnology sentiments and associated chemical phobia.

When astronomers considered where they\nmight find liquid water, they originally concentrated on planets that orbit at the proper distances from\ntheir host stars to maintain water in liquid form\u2014not too close in and not too far out. Thus we begin\nwith the tale of Goldilocks.\nOnce upon a time\u2014somewhat more than 4 billion years ago\u2014the formation of the solar system was\nnearly complete. Venus had formed sufficiently close to the Sun for the intense solar energy to\nvaporize what might have been its water supply. Mars formed so far away that its water supply\nbecame forever frozen. Only one planet, Earth, had a distance \u201cjust right\u201d for water to remain a\nliquid, and whose surface would therefore become a haven for life. This region around the Sun where\nwater can remain liquid came to be known as the habitable zone.\nGoldilocks liked things \u201cjust right,\u201d too. One of the bowls of porridge in the Three Bears\u2019 cottage\nwas too hot. Another was too cold. The third was just right, so she ate it. Upstairs, one bed was too\nhard. Another was too soft. The third was just right, so Goldilocks slept in it. When the Three Bears\ncame home, they discovered not only missing porridge but also Goldilocks fast asleep in their bed.\n(Don\u2019t remember how the story ends, but it remains a mystery to us why the Three Bears\u2014\nomnivorous and occupying the top of the food chain\u2014did not eat Goldilocks instead.)\nThe relative habitability of Venus, Earth, and Mars would intrigue Goldilocks, though the actual\nhistory of these planets is somewhat more complicated than three bowls of porridge. Four billion\nyears ago, leftover water-rich comets and mineral-rich asteroids were still pelting the planetary\nsurfaces, although at a much lower rate than before. During this game of cosmic billiards, some\nplanets had migrated inward from where they had formed while others were kicked into larger orbits.\nAnd among the dozens of planets that had formed, some moved on unstable orbits and crashed into the\nSun or Jupiter. Others were ejected from the solar system altogether. In the end, the few planets that\nremained had orbits that were \u201cjust right\u201d to survive billions of years.\nEarth settled into an orbit with an average distance of 93 million miles from the Sun. At this\ndistance, Earth intersects a measly one two-billionth of the total energy radiated by the Sun. If you\nassume that Earth absorbs all the energy received from the Sun, then our home planet\u2019s average\ntemperature should be about 280 degrees Kelvin (45\u02da F), which falls midway between winter and\nsummer temperatures.

In science you can sometimes get the right answer for the wrong reasons. Earth actually\nabsorbs only two thirds of the energy that reaches it from the Sun. The rest is reflected back into\nspace by Earth\u2019s surface (especially by the oceans) and by its clouds. If we factor this reflection into\nthe equations, the average temperature for Earth drops to about 255 degrees Kelvin, well below the\nfreezing point of water. Something must be operating to raise our average temperature to something a\nlittle more comfortable.\nBut wait once more. All theories of stellar evolution tell us that 4 billion years ago, when life was\nforming out of Earth\u2019s primordial soup, the Sun was a third less luminous than it is today, which\nwould have left Earth\u2019s average temperature even farther below freezing. Perhaps Earth in the distant\npast was simply closer to the Sun. Once the early period of heavy bombardment had ended, however,\nno known mechanisms could have shifted stable orbits back and forth within the solar system.\nPerhaps the greenhouse effect from Earth\u2019s atmosphere was stronger in the past. We don\u2019t know for\nsure. What we do know is that habitable zones, as originally conceived, have only peripheral\nrelevance to whether life may exist on a planet within them. This has become evident from the fact\nthat we cannot explain Earth\u2019s history on the basis of a simple habitable-zone model, and even more\nfrom the realization that water or other solvents need not depend on the heat from a star to remain\nliquid.\nOur solar system contains two good reminders that the \u201chabitable-zone approach\u201d to looking for life\nhas severe limitations. One of them lies outside the zone where the Sun can keep water liquid, yet\nnevertheless has a worldwide ocean of water. The other, far too cold for liquid water, offers the\npossibility of another liquid solvent, poison to us but potentially prime for other forms of life. Before\nlong we should have the opportunity to investigate both of these objects with close-up robot\nexplorers. Let\u2019s check out what we know now about Europa and Titan.\nJupiter\u2019s moon Europa\n, which has about the same size as our Moon, shows crisscrossing cracks in the\nsurface that change on time scales of weeks or months. To expert geologists and planetary scientists,\nthis behavior implies that Europa has a surface made almost entirely of water ice, like a giant\nAntarctic ice sheet girdling an entire world. And the changing appearance of the rifts and rills in this\nicy surface leads to a startling conclusion: The ice apparently floats on a worldwide ocean. Only by\ninvoking liquid beneath the icy surface can scientists satisfactorily explain what they have seen,\nthanks to the stunning successes of the \nVoyager\n and \nGalileo\n spacecraft. Since we observe changes on\nthe surface all around Europa, we may conclude that a worldwide ocean of liquid must underlie that\nsurface.\nWhat liquid could this be, and why should that substance remain liquid? Impressively, planetary\nscientists have reached two fairly firm additional conclusions: The liquid is water, and it remains\nliquid because of tidal effects on Europa produced by the giant planet Jupiter. The fact that water\nmolecules are more abundant than ammonia, ethane, or methyl alcohol makes it the likeliest substance\nto provide the liquid beneath Europa\u2019s ice, and the existence of this frozen water likewise implies\nthat more water exists in the immediate neighborhood.

Europa\u2019s\ninterior remains relatively warm because tidal forces from Jupiter and the two large moons nearby, Io\nand Ganymede, continuously flex the rocks within Europa as this moon changes its position with\nrespect to neighboring objects. At all times, the sides of Io and Europa closest to Jupiter feel a\nstronger force of gravity from the giant planet than the sides farthest away. These differences in force\nslightly elongate the solid moons in the direction facing Jupiter. But as the moons\u2019 distances from\nJupiter change during their orbits, Jupiter\u2019s tidal effect\u2014the difference in force exerted on the near\nside and the far side\u2014also changes, producing small pulses in their already distorted shapes. This\nchanging distortion heats the moons\u2019 interiors.

Inside Io, the\ntemperature rises to the point that volcanoes continually blast evil-smelling compounds of sulfur and\nsodium many miles above the satellite\u2019s surface. Io in fact has too high a temperature for liquid water\nto survive, but Europa, which undergoes less tidal flexing than Io because it is farther from Jupiter,\nheats more modestly, though still significantly. In addition, Europa\u2019s worldwide ice cap puts a\npressure lid on the liquid below, preventing the water from evaporating and allowing it to exist for\nbillions of years without freezing. So far as we can tell, Europa was born with its water ocean and\nice above, and has maintained that ocean, close to the freezing point but still above it, through four\nand a half billion years of cosmic history.\nAstrobiologists therefore view Europa\u2019s worldwide ocean as a prime target for investigation.

Nevertheless, the discovery of enormous masses of\norganisms at depths a mile or more beneath the basalts of Washington State, living mainly on\ngeothermal heat, suggests that we may someday find the Europan oceans alive with organisms unlike\nany on Earth.

Nearly seven years later, having received gravity boosts from\nVenus (twice) Earth (once), and Jupiter (once), the spacecraft reached the Saturn system, where it\nfired its rockets to achieve an orbit around the ringed planet.\nThe scientists who designed the mission arranged for the Huygens probe to detach itself from the\nCassini\n spacecraft late in 2004, to make the first descent through Titan\u2019s satellite\u2019s opaque clouds,\nand to reach the moon\u2019s surface, using a heat shield to avoid frictional burning from its rapid passage\nthrough the upper atmosphere and a series of parachutes to slow the probe down in the lower\natmosphere. Six instruments aboard the \nHuygens\n probe were built to measure the temperature,\ndensity, and chemical composition of Titan\u2019s atmosphere, and to send images back to Earth via the\nCassini\n spacecraft. At this time, we can only await these data and images to see what they tell us\nabout the enigma that lies beneath the clouds of Titan. We are unlikely to see life itself, should any\nexist on this faraway moon, but we can expect to determine whether or not conditions do favor the\nexistence of life by providing liquid pools and ponds in which life might originate and flourish. At the\nvery least, we may expect to learn the array of different types of molecules that exist on and near the\nsurface of Titan, which may shed new light on how the precursors of life arose on Earth and\nthroughout the solar system.\nIf we require\n water for life, must we restrict ourselves to planets and their moons, on whose solid\nsurfaces water can accumulate in quantity? Not at all. Water molecules, along with several other\nhousehold chemicals such as ammonia and methane and ethyl alcohol, appear routinely in cool\ninterstellar gas clouds. Under special conditions of low temperature and high density, an ensemble of\nwater molecules can be induced to transform and to funnel energy from a nearby star into an\namplified, high-intensity beam of microwaves.

Suppose that an average civilization, qualifying as a civilization by\npossessing interstellar communications ability, lasts for 10,000 years\u2014approximately one part in a\nmillion of the Milky Way\u2019s lifetime. On the optimistic view, a billion places give birth to a\ncivilization at some point in history, so at any representative time, about 1,000 civilizations should be\nflourishing. The pessimistic view, in contrast, implies that in each representative era about 0.001\ncivilization should exist, making ourselves a lone and lonely blip that temporarily rises high above\nthe average value.\nWhich estimate has the greater chance of coming close to the true value? In science, nothing\nconvinces so well as experimental evidence. If we hope to determine the average number of\ncivilizations in the Milky Way, the best scientific approach would measure how many civilizations\nnow exist. The most direct way to perform that feat would survey the entire galaxy, as the cast of\ntelevision\u2019s \nStar Trek\n love to do, noting the number and type of each civilization that we encounter, if\nindeed we find any. (The possibility of an alien-free galaxy makes for boring television, rarely\nappearing on the small screen.) Unfortunately, this survey lies far outside our current technological\ncapability and budgetary constraints.\nBesides, surveying the entire galaxy would take millions of years, if not longer. Consider what a\ntelevision program about interstellar space surveys would be like if it limited itself by what we know\nof physical reality. A typical hour would show the crew complaining and bickering, aware that they\nhad come so far yet still had so far to go. \u201cWe\u2019ve read all the magazines,\u201d one of them might remark.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick of each other, and you, Captain, are a great pain in the plethora.\u201d Then, while other crew\nmembers sang songs to themselves and still others entered private worlds of madness, a trailing long\nshot would remind us that the distances to other stars in the Milky Way are millions of times greater\nthan the distances to other planets in the solar system.\nActually, this ratio describes only the distances to the Sun\u2019s closer neighbors, already so distant that", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3848, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "515c0848-3039-46e2-b09d-939c640d4e4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "515c0848-3039-46e2-b09d-939c640d4e4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "148", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6c080ca-59a2-4672-9a2c-38cc259e957a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "148", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "d52e319e1f7ee483aea06b7e34d11de6197fe89813ec0b3e7af04c49e33dcca6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "their light takes many years to reach us. A full tour of the Milky Way would take us nearly ten\nthousand times farther. Hollywood films depicting interstellar space flight deal with this all-important\nissue by ignoring it (\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers, 1956 \nand\n 1978\n), assuming that better rockets or\nimproved understanding of physics will deal with it (\nStar Wars\n, 1977), or offering intriguing\napproaches such as freeze-drying astronauts so that they can survive immensely long journeys (\nPlanet\nof the Apes\n, 1968).\nAll of these approaches have a certain appeal, and some offer creative possibilities. We may indeed\nimprove our rockets, which can now reach speeds of only about one ten-thousandth of the speed of\nlight, the fastest we can hope to travel according to our current knowledge of physics. Even at the\nspeed of light, however, travel to the nearest stars will take many years, and travel across the Milky\nWay close to a thousand centuries. Freeze-drying astronauts has some promise, but so long as those on\nEarth, who presumably will pay for the trip and remain unfrozen, the long passages of time before the\nastronauts return argues against easy funding. Given our short attention spans, by far the better\napproach to establishing contact with extraterrestrial civilizations\u2014provided that they exist\u2014\nappears right here on Earth. All we need do is to wait for them to contact us. This costs far less and\ncan offer the immediate rewards that our society so eagerly craves.\nOnly one difficulty arises: Why should they? Just what about our planet makes us special to the point\nthat we merit attention from extraterrestrial societies, assuming that they exist? On this point more\nthan any other, humans have consistently violated the Copernican principle. Ask anyone why Earth\ndeserves scrutiny, and you are likely to receive a sharp, angry stare. Almost all conceptions of alien\nvisitors to Earth, as well as a sizable part of religious dogma, rest on the unspoken, obvious\nconclusion that our planet and our species rank so high on the list of universal marvels that no\nargument is needed to support the astronomically strange contention that our speck of dust, nearly lost\nin its Milky Way suburb, somehow stands out like a galactic beacon, not only demanding but also\nreceiving attention on a cosmic scale.\nThis conclusion springs from the fact that the actual situation appears reversed when we view the\ncosmos from Earth. Then planetary matters bulk large, while the stars seem tiny points of light. From\na quotidian point of view, this makes complete sense. Our success at survival and reproduction, like\nthat of every other organism, has little to do with the cosmos that surrounds us. Among all\nastronomical objects, only the Sun, and to a much lesser extent the Moon, affect our lives, and their\nmotions repeat with such regularity that they almost seem part of the Earthbound scene. Our human\nconsciousness, formed on Earth from countless encounters with terrestrial creatures and events,\nunderstandably renders the extraterrestrial scene as a far-distant backdrop to the important action at\ncenter stage. Our error lies in assuming that the backdrop likewise regards ourselves as the center of\nactivity.\nBecause each of us adopted this erroneous attitude long before our conscious minds attained any\ndominion or control over our patterns of thinking, we cannot eliminate it entirely from our approach\nto the cosmos even when we choose to do so. Those who impose the Copernican principle must\nremain ever vigilant against the murmurings of our reptilian brains, assuring us that we occupy the\ncenter of the universe, which naturally directs its attention our way.\nWhen we turn to reports of extraterrestrial visitors to Earth, we must recognize another fallacy of", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3792, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d85a23f-89e0-4349-967c-1212aa3d9d3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d85a23f-89e0-4349-967c-1212aa3d9d3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d9d1eb8-faa2-4a88-9ea3-3fc0dbe01614", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "ec5d24d5f3f42be0f0ce9e672f1abea59597d68a087295c4a31bc455147899b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "human thought, as omnipresent and self-deceiving as our anti-Copernican prejudices.

We transcribe congressional debates\nand laws in print, videotape crime scenes, and make surreptitious audio recordings of criminal\nactivity, because we recognize these media as superior to our own brains for creating a permanent\nrecord of past events. One great apparent exception to this rule remains. We continue to accept\neyewitness testimony as accurate, or at least probative, in legal proceedings. We do so despite test\nafter test that demonstrates that each of us, despite our best intentions, will fail to remember events\naccurately, especially when those memories\u2014as they usually do in cases important enough to go to\ntrial\u2014deal with unusual and exciting occurrences. Our legal system accepts eyewitness testimony\nfrom long traditition, because of its emotional resonance, and most of all because it often provides the\nonly direct evidence of past events.

By definition, UFOs are bizarre\noccurrences, which cause observers to discriminate among familiar and unfamiliar objects on the\nrarely examined celestial backdrop, and typically require rapid conclusions about these objects\nbefore they quickly disappear. Add to this the psychic charge arising from the observer\u2019s belief in\nhaving witnessed a tremendously unusual event, and we could hardly find a better textbook example\nof a situation likely to generate an erroneous memory.\nWhat can we do to obtain data on UFO reports more reliable than eyewitness accounts? In the\n1950s, astrophysicist J. Allen Hynek, then a leading Air Force consultant on UFOs, liked to highlight\nthis issue by whipping a miniature camera from his pocket, insisting that if he ever saw a UFO, he\nwould use the camera to obtain valid scientific evidence, because he knew that eyewitness testimony\nwould not qualify. Unfortunately, improvements in technology since that time allow the creation of\nfake images and video recordings barely distinguishable from honest ones, so that Hynek\u2019s plan\nwould no longer allow us to put our faith in photographic evidence supporting a UFO sighting. In fact,\nwhen we consider the interaction of memory\u2019s fragile power with the inventiveness of human con\nartists, we cannot easily devise a test to discriminate between fact and fancy for any individual UFO\nsighting.\nWhen we turn to the more modern phenomenon of UFO abductions, the ability of the human psyche\nto trump reality becomes even more apparent. Although hard numbers cannot be easily obtained, in\nrecent years tens of thousands of people have apparently come to believe that they have been taken\naboard an alien spacecraft and subjected to examinations, often of the most humiliating variety. From\na calm perspective, stating this claim suffices to refute it as reality.

These effects pass through the filters of our brains to yield\nseemingly real memories, capable of arousing unshakable belief in their certainty.\nCompare this explanation of UFO abductions with an alternative, that extraterrestrial visitors have\nsingled out Earth and arrived in sufficient numbers to abduct humans by the thousands, though only\nbriefly, and apparently to examine them closely (but should they not have long ago learned whatever\nthey cared to\u2014and could they not abduct sufficient corpses to learn human anatomy in detail?).

The second explanation raises an intriguing\nconundrum.

This attitude was captured well in\nthe classic film \nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\n (1951), in which an alien visitor, far wiser than we,\ncomes to Earth to warn that our violent behavior may lead to our own destruction.\nOur innate feelings about the cosmos manifest a dark side that projects our feelings about human\nstrangers onto nonhuman visitors.

Neither can be\nregarded as absolute bars to this interpretation, but in tandem they form a powerful argument. Must\nwe, then, conclude that because Earth lacks popular appeal, our hopes of finding other civilizations\nmust await the day when we can expend our own resources to embark on journeys to other planetary\nsystems?\nNot at all. The scientific approach to establishing contact with other civilizations within the Milky\nWay and beyond, should they exist, has always relied on letting nature work in our favor. This\nprinciple redirects the question: What aspect of extraterrestrial civilizations would we find most\nexciting? (answer: Visitors in the flesh) into the scientifically fruitful one: What seems to be the most\nlikely means of establishing contact with other civilizations? Nature, and the immense distances\nbetween stars, supply the answer\u2014use the cheapest, fastest means of communication avaiable, which\npresumably holds the same rank elsewhere in the galaxy.\nThe cheapest and fastest way to send messages between the stars uses electromagnetic radiation, the\nsame medium that carries almost all long-range communication on Earth. Radio waves have\nrevolutionized human society by allowing us to send words and pictures around the world at 186,000\nmiles per second. These messages travel so rapidly that even if we beam them up to a stationary\nsatellite orbiting at an altitude of 23,000 miles, which relays them to another part of Earth\u2019s surface,\nthey undergo a time delay on each leg of their journey much shorter than one second.\nOver interstellar distances, the time lag grows longer, though it remains the shortest we can hope to\nachieve. If we plan to send a radio message to Alpha Centauri, the star system closest to the Sun, we\nmust plan on a travel time of 4.4 years in each direction. Messages that travel for, say, twenty years\ncan reach several hundred stars, or any planets that orbit them. Thus if we are prepared to wait for a\nround-trip of forty years, we could beam a message toward each of these stars, and eventually find\nout whether we receive a reply from any of them.

Forty years is a long time to wait for something that may\nnever happen. (Yet if we had beamed out messages forty years ago, by now we would have some\nserious information about the abundance of radio-using civilizations in our region of the Milky Way.)\nThe only serious attempt in this direction occurred in the 1970s, when astronomers celebrated the\nupgrading of the radio telescope near Arecibo, Puerto Rico, by using it to beam a message for a few\nminutes in the direction of the star cluster M13. Since the cluster lies 25,000 light-years away, any\nreturn message will be a long time coming, rendering the exercise more a demonstration than an\nactual casting call. In case you think that discretion has inhibited our broadcasting (for it is good to be\nshifty in a new country), recall that all of our post\u2013World War II radio and television broadcasting, as\nwell as our powerful radar beams, have sent spherical shells of radio waves into space. Expanding at\nthe speed of light, the \u201cmessages\u201d from the \nHoneymooners\n and \nI Love Lucy\n era have already washed\nover thousands of stars, while \nHawaii Five-O\n and \nCharlie\u2019s Angels \nhave reached hundreds.

Herein lies the\ngreatest appeal of communication by electromagnetic radiation. Not only is it cheap (sending fifty\nyears of television broadcasts into space has cost lest than a single spacecraft mission), it is also\ninstantaneous\u2014provided that we can receive and interpret another civilization\u2019s emission. This also\nprovides a fundamental aspect of UFO excitement, but in this case we might actually receive\ntransmissions that could be recorded, verified as real, and studied for as long as it would take to\nunderstand them.\nIn the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, shortened to SETI by the scientists who engage in it,\nthe focus remains on searching for radio signals, though the alternative of looking for signals sent with\nlight waves should not be rejected. Although light waves from another civilization must compete with\nmyriad natural sources of light, laser beams offer the opportunity to concentrate the light into a single\ncolor or frequency\u2014the same approach that allows radio waves to carry messages from different\nradio or television stations. So far as radio waves go, our hopes for success in SETI rest with\nantennas that can survey the sky, receivers that record what the antennas detect, and powerful\ncomputers that analyze the receivers\u2019 signals in a search for the unnatural. Two basic possibilities\nexist: We might find another civilization by eavesdropping on its own communications, some of\nwhich leaks into space in the same way that our radio and television broadcasts do; or we might\ndiscover deliberately beamed signals, meant to attract the attention of previously uncatalogued\ncivilizations such as our own.\nEavesdropping clearly presents a more difficult task.

Our own civilization has leaked signals for many decades, and has sent a beamed\nsignal in one particular direction for a few minutes. If civilizations are rare, any attempts to find them\nought to concentrate on eavesdropping and avoid the lure of hoping for deliberately beamed signals.\nWith ever better systems of antennas and receivers, SETI proponents have begun to eavesdrop on\nthe cosmos, hoping to find evidence for other civilizations. Precisely because we have no guarantee\nthat we shall ever hear anything by eavesdropping, those who engage in these activities have had\ndifficulty securing funding. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Congress supported a SETI program for a\nyear, until cooler heads pulled the plug. SETI scientists now draw their supports, in part, from\nmillions of people who download a screen saver (from the Web site setiathome.sl.berkeley.edu) that\nco-opts home computers to analyze data for alien signals in their spare time. Even more funding has\ncome from wealthy individuals, most notably the late Bernard Oliver, a prominent Hewlett-Packard\nengineer with a lifelong interest in SETI, and Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. Oliver spent\nmany years thinking about the basic problem in SETI, the difficulty of searching through billions of\npossible frequencies at which other civilizations might be broadcasting. We divide the radio spectrum\ninto relatively wide bands, so that only a few hundred different frequencies exist for radio and\ntelevision broadcasts. In principle, however, alien signals might be confined so narrowly in\nfrequency that the SETI dial would need billions of entries. Powerful computer systems, which lie at\nthe heart of current SETI efforts, can meet this challenge by analyzing hundreds of millions of\nfrequencies simultaneously. On the other hand, they have not yet found anything suggestive of another\ncivilization\u2019s radio communications.\nMore than fifty years ago, the Italian genius Enrico Fermi, perhaps the last great physicist to work\nboth as an experimentalist and as a theorist, discussed extraterrestrial life during lunch with his\ncolleagues. Agreeing that nothing particularly special distinguishes Earth as an abode for life, the\nscientists reached the conclusion that life ought to be abundant in the Milky Way. In that case, Fermi\nasked, in a query that ripples across the decades, \nwhere are they?\nFermi meant that if many places in our galaxy have seen the advent of technologically advanced\ncivilizations, surely we should have heard from one of them by now, by radio or laser messages if not\nby actual visits. Even if most civilizations die out quickly, as ours may, the existence of large numbers\nof civilizations implies that some of them should have sufficiently extended lifetimes to mount long-\nterm searches for others. Even if some of these long-lived civilizations do not care to engage in such\nsearches, others will.

Hubble, 1948\nH\numan senses display an astonishing acuity and range of sensitivity. Our ears can record the\nthunderous launch of the space shuttle, yet they can also hear a male mosquito buzzing in the corner of\na room. Our sense of touch allows us to feel the crush of a bowling ball dropped on our big toe, or to\ntell when a one-milligram bug crawls along our arm. Some people enjoy munching on habanero\npeppers, while sensitive tongues can identify the presence of food flavors at a few parts per million.\nAnd our eyes can register the bright sandy terrain on a sunny beach, yet have no trouble spotting a\nlone match, freshly lit hundreds of feet away, across a darkened auditorium. Our eyes also allow us to\nsee across the room and across the universe. Without our vision, the science of astronomy would\nnever have been born and our capacity to measure our place in the universe would have remained\nhopelessly stunted.\nIn combination, these senses allow us to decode the basics of our immediate environment, such as\nwhether it\u2019s day or night, or when a creature is about to eat you. But little did anybody know, until the\nlast few centuries, that our senses alone offer only a narrow window on the physical universe.\nSome people boast of a sixth sense, professing to know or see things that others cannot.\nFortunetellers, mind readers, and mystics top the list of those who claim mysterious powers. In doing\nso, they instill widespread fascination in others. The questionable field of parapsychology rests on\nthe expectation that at least some people actually harbor this talent.\nIn contrast, modern science wields dozens of senses. But scientists do not claim that these are the\nexpression of special powers, just special hardware that converts the information gleaned by these\nextra senses into simple tables, charts, diagrams, or images that our five inborn senses can interpret.\nWith apologies to Edwin P. Hubble, his remark quoted on page 291, while poignant and poetic,\nshould instead have been\nEquipped with our five senses, along with telescopes and microscopes and mass spectrometers\nand seismographs and magnetometers and particle detectors and accelerators and instruments that\nrecord radiation from the entire electromagnetic spectrum, we explore the universe around us and\ncall the adventure science.\nThink of how much richer the world would appear to us, and how much sooner we would have\ndiscovered the fundamental nature of the universe, if we were born with high-precision, tunable\neyeballs.

Its basic premise is the \u201cequivalence principle,\u201d according to which a person in a\nspaceship, for example, cannot distinguish whether the spaceship is accelerating through space, or\nwhether it is stationary in a gravitational field that would produce the same acceleration. From this\nsimple yet profound principle emerges a completely reworked understanding of the nature of gravity.\nAccording to Einstein, gravity is not a \nforce\n in the traditional meaning of the word. Gravity is the\ncurvature of space in the vicinity of a mass. The motion of a nearby object is completely determined\nby its velocity and the amount of curvature that is present. As counterintuitive as this sounds, general\nrelativity theory explains all known behavior of gravitational systems ever studied and it predicts a\nmyriad of even more counterintuitive phenomena that are continually verified by controlled\nexperiment. For example, Einstein predicted that a strong gravity field should warp space and\nnoticeably bend light in its vicinity. It was later shown that starlight passing near the edge of the Sun\n(as seen during a total solar eclipse) is found to be displaced from its expected position by an amount\nprecisely matching Einstein\u2019s predictions. Perhaps the grandest application of the general theory of\nrelativity involves the description of our expanding universe where all of space is curved from the\ncollected gravity of hundreds of billions of galaxies.

The newly discovered hardiness of some forms\nof bacteria and other life forms on Earth has expanded the list of environments where we may hope to\nfind life in the universe.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 912, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3eba9952-fc14-497f-9ea5-2db6af3edd6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3eba9952-fc14-497f-9ea5-2db6af3edd6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "277", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c8166c4-5aa7-427d-a32a-806e7ed2f506", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "277", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "186127b97f3965b37f71e0407dfb87487e9de65713d03f51fb0a67f705267a5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f03b65e4-e494-4b12-9ddd-e318fdc651d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f03b65e4-e494-4b12-9ddd-e318fdc651d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "278", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c4ecb9-0229-4b2c-b9df-fbd08abd3cb6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "278", "file_name": "Tyson-Origins.pdf"}, "hash": "fabe6e0568d46bc84ad4e15e5dcfd64e7cd5389db9ffd9df9580c912dae93d23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "40:\n Dr. Seth Shostak, of the SETI Insitute (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), and one of the\nauthors (NDT) take a moment to pose between takes of \nOrigins\n on location at the Arecibo Radio\nTelescope in Puerto Rico.
